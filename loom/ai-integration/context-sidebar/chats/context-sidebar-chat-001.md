# context-sidebar Chat

## Rafa:

- Decisions for `loom/ai-integration/context-sidebar/context-sidebar-design.md`

§1 Tree placement -> Actually extension already have a context panel that update depending of tree node selected with the pinned and opt-in contex
So I do not understand your question, tell me...

§3 Prefs schema -> The context panel already use some icons. The new ones you propose looks nice also.

§4 Write path -> B

§6 Re-render strategy -> A

What you think? You were not aware of current CONTEXT panel?
All clear?
Update design and plan

## AI:

You're right to call this out. No — I designed §1 from the idea/design docs, and neither mentions the existing panel. I went and read the code (`packages/vscode/src/providers/contextSidebarProvider.ts`). Here's what's actually there and how it changes the picture.

### What already exists

The `ContextSidebarProvider` is a real, registered view that:

- Is **top-level and follows tree focus** — it retargets on `onSelectionChanged(node)`. That is **Option B from §1**, already in code.
- Renders two sections: **Pinned** (idea, design, active plan, weave ctx, global ctx) and **Opt-in** (chats, ref docs), each doc with a **token estimate**, plus per-section and **Total** counts. So part of what I'd parked as "Phase 5 token viz" is already here.
- Lets you toggle each row on/off; the loaded ids feed launches via `getSelectedIds()` → `buildPrompt(...)` → the `claude "..."` invocation in doStep / refine / refinePlan.

So §1 is effectively **already decided as B**. My lean (A — per-target child node) was made not knowing this panel existed; I'm dropping it. We keep B.

### The real gap (this reframes the whole thread)

The existing panel does **not** use the pipeline. It re-derives context locally with its own pinned/opt-in heuristic — a *second, parallel implementation* of context assembly that can silently drift from the `ContextBundle` the AI actually receives. And:

- Toggles are **ephemeral** — an in-memory `loaded` flag, reset on every focus change. Nothing is persisted; there is no `.loom/context-prefs.json` write.
- Selections influence launches via **prompt text**, not the pipeline's `overrides` argument.
- Icons are only ✓ / ○ — no `reason` distinction.

So this thread's job is **not "build a new surface."** It's **rebase the existing panel onto the pipeline**: feed it from `loom://context/{target}?mode=`, render `BundledDoc.reason` with the §2 symbols, and make toggles persist through `loom_set_context_prefs` → `.loom/context-prefs.json`. That's the root-cause fix — it collapses the two context derivations into one, so "what you see == what the AI gets" is true *by construction* instead of by two implementations happening to agree. The current code is the open trust loop the idea describes, in concrete form.

This also means **plan step 3** ("Add a `Context (N docs)` child node under valid launch targets") is now wrong — it builds the A surface I no longer recommend. It should become "rebase `ContextSidebarProvider` onto the bundle."

### Decisions from your message

- **§1 Tree placement → B** (resolved by existing code; supersedes my A lean). ✔
- **§4 Write path → B** (MCP tool). ✔ — net-new, since nothing persists today.
- **§6 Re-render → A** (always re-run). ✔ — today the panel never runs the pipeline, so adopting A means: on toggle, persist via `loom_set_context_prefs`, then re-read `loom://context`.

### Two things still open

Your "§3" note was actually about **icons — that's §2**. You approved the richer symbol set; the panel only has ✓/○ today, so we upgrade to it. Good.

But the *real* **§3 (the `.loom/context-prefs.json` JSON schema — A/B/C)** and **§5 (`load: always` exclude UX)** are still unanswered:

- **§3** — my lean is **A** (mode-agnostic per-target: `{ [targetId]: { include, exclude } }`). Simplest; grows to per-mode later without breaking.
- **§5** — my lean is **warn-on-confirm**: excluding a 🔒 `load: always` ref pops a confirm dialog, then surfaces as 🚫 with an "overrides always" badge.

I'd rather not rewrite design + plan yet — the reframing above changes §1's premise and step 3, and baking in the wrong step 3 now would just cost a second rewrite. Give me §3 and §5 (or confirm my leans), plus a nod on the "rebase the existing panel" framing, and I'll update both docs in one pass.

## Rafa:

§3 A
§5 warn-on-confirm

## AI:

Done — design and plan updated.

**Design** (`context-sidebar-design.md`): decisions log filled (§1 B, §2 symbol set, §3 A, §4 B, §5 warn-on-confirm, §6 A); a reframing box up top stating the panel already exists and the work is rebasing it onto the pipeline; A-lean in §1 marked superseded; and a new **§10 — Launch-path collapse** documenting the ephemeral `context_ids` prompt-arg channel and the decision to remove it in favor of persisted prefs read by both the resource and `loom_do_step`. I flagged §10 with an explicit "veto here if you want to keep an ephemeral channel" — it's the one decision you haven't directly seen, since it came out of reading the code.

**Plan** (`context-sidebar-plan-001.md`): goal rewritten as a rebase (not greenfield); step 3 changed from "add a Context child node" → "rebase `ContextSidebarProvider` onto the bundle"; step 4 now persists toggles via `loom_set_context_prefs` and deletes `getSelectedIds()`/the `context_ids` arg; added file lists and step dependency chain (1→2→3→4→5→6).

One thing to eyeball: **§10**. Removing the ephemeral channel means every override persists to `.loom/context-prefs.json` (reset-to-auto is the undo) — there's no "this launch only, don't save" mode. That's consistent with the idea's chosen mechanism, but it's a behavior change to the current panel, so confirm it's what you want.

If §10 sits right, the plan is ready to start (step 1: the two MCP tools).

## Rafa:

§10 Ok

Do whole plan


## AI:

Implemented the plan through step 4, all green (`build-all` + `test-all`, 13 test files incl. the new prefs unit test and an MCP exclusion round-trip). Then I hit a real fork at step 5 and stopped per the design-decision rule.

**Done & verified (steps 1–4):**
- **1.** `.loom/context-prefs.json` layer: `ContextPrefs` types (core), a fs repository (replace semantics, reset, missing-file create, malformed-JSON repair), and `loom_set_context_prefs` / `loom_get_context_prefs` MCP tools. Unit test green.
- **2.** Wired prefs into the **one** chokepoint — `handleContextResource`. Confirmed by grep that do-step, do-next-step, generate, continue-thread, weave-design/plan *all* route through it, so that single hook makes every launch honour persisted overrides. Integration test: exclude → doc gone from the bundle → get round-trips → reset restores.
- **3.** Rebased `ContextSidebarProvider` off its local heuristic onto the bundle. Added a `?format=json` variant to the context resource (same assembler/prefs, structured output) so the sidebar renders reasons/flags. Rows: ✓ auto · 📌 user-include · 🔒 always-locked · 🚫 excluded · ○ available · ❌ missing, with token counts straight from the bundle. Added a small `alwaysLocked` flag to `BundledDoc` for 🔒.
- **4.** Toggles persist via `loom_set_context_prefs` → re-read → refresh (§6). **§10 done:** deleted `getSelectedIds()` and removed the `context_ids` prompt-arg channel from doStep/refine/refinePlan/generateDesign/generatePlan. Launches now read prefs only — one source of truth.

**Also done from step 5:** ⚠ stale badge, ❌ missing badge, and the 🔒 warn-on-confirm modal.

**STOP — design decision (the ⊘ symbol).** ⊘ in §2/§5 means "you excluded this, but another doc's `requires_load` pulls it back in." Implementing it as designed requires changing the **shipped, tested** pure assembler, and the design text conflicts with what the assembler actually does today:

- **Today:** in `assembleContext`, a `requires_load` add of a user-excluded id is *blocked* — **user-exclude wins** over requires_load. So the ⊘ case can't occur; an excluded doc stays excluded even if something needs it.
- **Design §5 last row says the opposite:** **requires_load wins**, and we surface ⊘ "required by X" so you see your exclude was overridden.
- Separately, the §2 flavour of ⊘ (a `load_when`-filtered ref pulled in by requires_load) also can't be shown today because the assembler *erases* that provenance (it clears the `load_when-filter` exclusion once the doc is emitted).

So ⊘ needs a precedence flip + provenance preservation in the Phase-1/2 assembler. That's a behavior change to shipped pipeline code — I won't make it silently. Options:

- **A — Implement §5 as written (requires_load wins, mark ⊘ + `requiredBy`).** Faithful to the design; a doc genuinely needed by another can't be starved by an exclude; you still *see* the override. Cost: change the `add()` precedence + add `requiredBy`/a filtered-but-required flag to `BundledDoc`, update the assembler test.
- **B — Keep user-exclude absolute (current behavior); drop ⊘.** Your exclude always wins, full stop. Simpler, no assembler change. Cost: a doc you exclude that another doc requires just won't be there — silently — which is exactly the footgun §5 was written to prevent.
- **C — Hybrid:** requires_load overrides the exclude (A's safety) **only** for the §5 case, and we also preserve the §2 filtered-but-required marker. Most faithful to the design, most assembler work.

My lean is **A** — it's what §5 already decided and it prevents silent context starvation. But it touches shipped pipeline semantics, so I want your call before editing the assembler. Steps 1–4 stand regardless of which you pick.

**Next:** pick A / B / C for ⊘, then I finish step 5 and run the step-6 smoke test. (Step 6's automated half — exclude → absent from bundle → prefs file shows it — is already effectively proven by the integration test; the in-VS-Code click-through is the manual part.)

## Rafa:

A

## AI:

Went with **A**. Plan-001 is now **done** (all 6 steps ✅), build + full suite green.

**§5 / ⊘ implemented (option A):**
- Assembler: `requires_load` now overrides a user-exclude (reason → `user-exclude-overridden`, carries `requiredBy`); `resolveRequiresLoad` threads the requiring doc's id through its queue; `requiredBy` is also set when requires_load overrides a `load_when` filter (§2 flavour); `finalExcluded` drops any exclusion record for a doc that actually ended up emitted. New `requiredBy` field on `BundledDoc`.
- Test: excluding `rf-A` (which `c1` requires) keeps it as `user-exclude-overridden` + `requiredBy`, absent from `excluded[]`; the unrelated-exclude case still drops the doc.
- Sidebar: ⊘ row (yellow check, `ctx-required`) with tooltip "you excluded this, but {requiredBy} requires it — included anyway" and a reset action.

**Whole P3 in one line:** the CONTEXT panel is now a pure view of the pipeline bundle — what you see is what the AI gets, by construction — with persistent per-target include/exclude in `.loom/context-prefs.json`, and the old ephemeral `context_ids` launch channel is gone.

**Two honest loose ends:**
1. **Manual UI click-through (step 6)** — I verified the data path end-to-end via the MCP integration test, but the literal "open chat → click 🚫 → click Reply → eyeball the missing 📄 line" needs a live Extension Development Host I can't drive. Worth a quick F5 to confirm the icons / inline actions / warn-modal render as intended.
2. **`loom-context-pipeline-reference.md`** still lists **P3 as pending** in its phase table. It's a hand-maintained ref (outside the MCP gate). Want me to flip P3 → shipped there? Say the word and I'll update it.

Next: waiting for direction — your F5 smoke check, the reference-doc update, or something else.

## Rafa:

### Context
Selecting a context file should open it in VSCode editor

### Archive
Last time you archive manually loom docs you did it wrong.
This is the correct way:

- All archived docs live in `loom/.archive`
- Any weave, thread or loom doc file should be archived by moving it to:
    `loom/.archive/{weave}/{thread}/...`

### Reference docs
In case needed, update these `loom/refs/` docs
`architecture-reference.md`
`loom-context-pipeline-reference.md`
`workspace-directory-structure-reference.md`
`loom-context-pipeline-reference.md`


## AI:

All three points, in order.

**1 · Open-in-editor — already wired; if it's dead, it's failing silently.**
Selecting a context row already calls `loom.context.openDoc` (`contextSidebarProvider.ts:314` → `openDoc()` at `:228`), which resolves the row id via `loom_find_doc` and opens the file with `showTextDocument({ preview: false })`. `findDocumentById` scans the whole `loom/` tree (refs included, `.archive` excluded), so both docs *and* refs should open on select.

So either it already works in your F5 host, or — more likely, since loose-end #1 (live click-through) was never tested — it's dropping into the empty `catch` / reject handlers in `openDoc`, which swallow every error. That happens when (a) `loom_find_doc` throws because the row's id has no matching frontmatter `id` (a ref missing an `id:` field, or a bare excluded-id row), or (b) the MCP call rejects. Either way you'd see *nothing* — no file, no error, no clue.

Root-cause fix, not a patch: stop swallowing. On failure show `vscode.window.showWarningMessage("Couldn't open {id}: {err}")` so a non-opening click tells you *why*, and confirm every `loom/refs/*.md` carries a frontmatter `id`. One file, small change.

**2 · Archive convention — understood, and the tree already matches it.**
Confirmed: archived docs live at `loom/.archive/{weave}/{thread}/...`, never an in-thread `.archive/`. The working tree already reflects the correction — `loom/.archive/ai-integration/load-when/` and `.../reference-load-context/` exist, and the old in-thread copies are deleted. `findMarkdownFiles` skips `.archive`, so those docs correctly fall out of derived state. I'll use this path for every future archive and I'm saving it to memory so the earlier mistake doesn't repeat. (Worth a separate check that the `loom_archive` MCP tool writes to exactly this path — say so and I'll verify it.)

**3 · Reference docs — the diff I'd make; confirm and I'll write them (they're outside the MCP gate, so direct edits are fine):**
- `loom-context-pipeline-reference.md` — flip **P3: pending → shipped** in the phase table (loose-end #2 from my last turn), and note `.loom/context-prefs.json` + `loom_get/set_context_prefs` + the removal of the ephemeral `context_ids` launch channel.
- `architecture-reference.md` — record the two new MCP tools and the launch-path collapse (overrides now flow from prefs through `loom://context` / `loom_do_step`, not a prompt arg).
- `workspace-directory-structure-reference.md` — add `.loom/context-prefs.json` and document the `loom/.archive/{weave}/{thread}/` archive layout from point 2.

Next: tell me which to run — (a) the openDoc error-surfacing fix, (b) the three ref-doc updates, (c) both — and I'll go.

## AI:

Both done. Build green (`build-all.sh`).

**1 · openDoc error-surfacing fix** — `contextSidebarProvider.ts:228`
Rewrote `openDoc` as `async` (matching its `exclude`/`include`/`reset` neighbours). It now `await`s `loom_find_doc` → `openTextDocument` → `showTextDocument({ preview: false })` inside one `try`, and on *any* failure (id unresolved, parse error, open error) shows `vscode.window.showWarningMessage("Couldn't open {id}: {err}")` instead of the two empty swallow-handlers. A non-opening click now tells you why. Verified every `loom/refs/*.md` carries a frontmatter `id`, so refs resolve — the silent catch was the only real failure path.

**2 · Reference docs**
- `loom-context-pipeline-reference.md` — **P3 flipped pending → ✅ shipped** in the phase table (with the rebase/7-symbol/tools/launch-collapse summary), plus a new "Phase 3 shipped" bullet in the implementation-status section.
- `architecture-reference.md` — added `loom_get_context_prefs` / `loom_set_context_prefs` to Key tools and `.loom/context-prefs.json` to the directory tree.
- `workspace-directory-structure-reference.md` — added `.loom/context-prefs.json`, and **corrected the archive model to a single root**: removed the per-weave / per-thread `.archive/` entries, pointed everything at `loom/.archive/{weave}/{thread}/...`, fixed the 3-level scope table row, and added an "Archiving uses one root" rule (point 2).

Next: waiting for direction — optionally a live F5 to confirm the warning fires on a bad click, or close.

## Rafa:

When I click over any context files produces an error of this kind:

```
Couldn't open de_01KSTFZXP06VXHFDYG1FGAK1KT: no file path resolved
```

It looks path is always wrong

## AI:

That error is the real bug surfacing — and it's a double-parse, not a path problem. Found and fixed the root cause.

**Root cause.** The extension's `callTool` wrapper (`mcp-client.ts:155-157`) *already* unwraps the MCP envelope and `JSON.parse`s the first text-content. So `callTool('loom_find_doc', …)` hands back the parsed `{ id, filePath }` object directly. But `openDoc` was re-reading `res.content[0].text` — which on the already-unwrapped object is `undefined` → `?? '{}'` → `{}` → `.filePath` undefined → "no file path resolved". Every click failed identically, regardless of the doc — exactly what you saw.

**Why P3's smoke test missed it.** Step 6 verified the data path through the *MCP integration test*, which calls the server directly and gets the raw envelope. The extension's `callTool` wrapper sits only in the live host — so the double-parse only bites on a real click. This is loose-end #1 (no live click-through) coming due.

**The same bug was hiding in `currentPrefs`** (line 172-173): it double-parsed `loom_get_context_prefs` too, so it *always* returned empty `{ include: [], exclude: [] }`. That means every toggle merged onto an empty base and silently dropped your other overrides for that target. Fixed alongside.

**Fix (both call sites — the only two `callTool`-result parses in the codebase):**
- `openDoc`: `const filePath = res?.filePath;`
- `currentPrefs`: `return { include: res?.entry?.include ?? [], exclude: res?.entry?.exclude ?? [] };`
- Both now use the already-parsed result; added a comment at each so the next person doesn't re-introduce the envelope assumption.

Build green. The error-surfacing from last round stays — it's what turned a silent no-op into a one-line diagnosis, and it'll still catch a genuinely missing doc.

Next: F5 and click a context row — it should open the file now (and toggles should preserve prior excludes). Tell me how it behaves.

## Rafa:

Create a Loom User Guide `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` with info about how to use Loom extension:

- workflow: chat -> idea -> design -> plans -> done
- context/reference: how to always provide to AI the related to actual work stream context using global and weave ctx docs, reference, required_load, load_when, etc. And how to use CONTEXT pnal of extension.

Include anything you consider useful for final Users to get the most of loom capabilities.

First show me a draft schema, tell me what you think, stop

## AI:

Here's the draft schema for `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`, written for an **end user of the Loom extension** (someone using Loom on *their* project — not a contributor to this repo). Vision link: this guide directly serves the two pipeline promises — *"you see exactly what the AI saw"* and *"you stay in control"* — and removes the manual step of "figure out Loom by reading the design docs."

### Proposed outline

**1. What is Loom** *(½ page)*
The one promise: your Markdown docs are the database, the AI is stateful through those docs, and nothing happens without your approval. What problem it removes (re-explaining context to the AI every session).

**2. Setup** *(task-oriented)*
- Install the extension · run `loom install` in your project · what `.loom/` and `loom/` are
- Connect the AI: Claude Code CLI path (default) vs. API-key path — one paragraph each, with the "which do I have?" decision
- Open the Loom view; tour of the three panels (tree, toolbar, CONTEXT)

**3. Core concepts at a glance** *(one table)*
Weave · Thread · Loose fiber · the doc types (idea / design / plan / done / chat / ctx / reference). Just enough vocabulary to read the rest.

**4. The workflow loop: chat → idea → design → plan → done**
- A diagram + one subsection per stage: *what it's for · how you create it (toolbar button or promote) · what the AI does · what you approve*
- The step-by-step rhythm: do-step → ✅ → **STOP for `go`**, and why the human gate exists
- How `done` closes a thread

**5. Giving the AI the right context** *(the heart — what you asked for)*
- Mental model: "the AI always knows where it is," assembled *before* it runs, never left to chance
- **ctx docs** — global (`loom/ctx.md`) + weave (`loom/{weave}/ctx.md`); auto-loaded by *scope* (you don't list them anywhere); refresh with the ctx button / `loom_refresh_ctx`. Note: **no thread ctx** — a thread's idea/design/plan load in full.
- **reference docs** — `load: always` vs `by-request`, and `load_when` to scope a ref to certain modes (design/plan/implementing)
- **`requires_load`** — per-doc explicit "read these first" citations
- How they combine: broad → specific → citations (one ordered list)
- **The CONTEXT panel** — see every doc that *would* load *before* you click; the symbol legend (✓ 📌 🚫 ⊘ 🔒 ⚠ ❌); include / exclude / reset toggles; click a row to open the doc; overrides persist in `.loom/context-prefs.json`

**6. Working with the AI day-to-day**
Chat replies, refine, generate; the CLI-vs-sampling distinction in one note; where replies land (inside the chat doc).

**7. Keeping context fresh** *(staleness)*
What "stale" means (plan vs design version, ctx age), the ⚠ marker, how to refresh.

**8. Tips & getting the most out of Loom** *(bulleted)*
e.g. trim context before a big launch, use chats as durable memory, when to promote vs. start fresh.

**9. Troubleshooting / FAQ**
MCP not connected · context not loading · "the AI ignored a doc" → check the CONTEXT panel.

### What I think
- **Audience & scope:** I'd write it extension-first (since you said "extension"), with the CLI mentioned only where it matters (the Claude Code launch path). It should avoid all repo-internals jargon — no `packages/`, reducers, or layering talk. Pure user POV.
- **Section 5 carries the guide.** It's the differentiator and the hardest thing for users to grok, so it gets the most room and a worked example ("you open a chat in the auth thread — here's exactly what loads and why").
- **Screenshots:** I'd leave labelled placeholders (`![CONTEXT panel](…)`) rather than block on assets — there's a `vscode-gif-demo` thread that can fill them later.
- **One file, not a `docs/` tree** — matches your request and keeps it skimmable with a top TOC.

Three small calls I'd like your steer on (folded in so you don't have to stop me later):
1. Extension-first with CLI asides — or give the CLI equal weight?
2. Include the worked end-to-end example in §5, or keep it abstract?
3. Screenshot placeholders now, or omit image refs entirely until the gifs exist?

STOP — waiting for go (and your answers to the three).

## Rafa:

1. What if we create 2 docs? something like `docs/EXTENSION_USER_GUIDE.md` & `docs/CLI_USER_GUIDE.md` depending of how user want to use Loom, they will get the proper guide, what you think?
2. Start with abstract and then an end-to-end example, do you like it?
3. omit refs for now

## AI:

**2 — yes, I like it.** Abstract-then-concrete is the right teaching order: explain the context model in the general case, then a single end-to-end walkthrough that makes it click. I'll do that in §5.

**3 — noted**, no image refs for now.

**1 — I'd push back slightly, and here's why.** Two *fully standalone* guides means ~70% of the content is identical between them — concepts, the chat→idea→design→plan→done loop, the entire context system (ctx / reference / requires_load / load_when), staleness, tips. Only **setup** and **how you trigger an action** (toolbar buttons vs. terminal commands/prompts) genuinely differ. Duplicating the shared 70% across two files is exactly the drift trap this repo fights with its two CLAUDE.md surfaces — they *will* fall out of sync the first time you update the context section in one and forget the other.

So three ways to give users "the proper guide" without that trap:

- **A — Two standalone guides** (your proposal). Pro: one linear read, nothing irrelevant. Con: 70% duplication → guaranteed drift; two files to maintain forever.
- **B — One guide, shared core + two "how you drive it" sections.** Pro: zero duplication, single source. Con: each user scrolls past the other surface's bits; no clean per-surface entry point.
- **C — Shared core + two thin surface guides (my recommendation).** `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` holds the shared 70% (concepts, workflow, context system, staleness, tips). `docs/EXTENSION_USER_GUIDE.md` and `docs/CLI_USER_GUIDE.md` are short: setup + how-to-trigger + that surface's specifics, each opening with "New to Loom? Read [Core concepts & workflow](USER_GUIDE.md) first," then linking back for the deep sections.

**C gives you exactly what you wanted** — a user picks their path and lands on a guide written for them — while keeping the concepts in *one* place so they can't drift. It mirrors how this repo already splits the two CLAUDE.md surfaces (shared logical contract, surface-specific specifics). The only cost is one cross-link hop for the conceptual material, which is fair for end users.

If you'd rather optimize for "zero clicks, fully self-contained per surface" and accept the maintenance cost, A is legitimate — your call, since it's a structure/UX trade-off.

STOP — tell me A or C (B if you want it) and I'll build it.

## AI:

Built option C — three docs under `docs/`:

- **`docs/USER_GUIDE.md`** (shared core) — what Loom is · core concepts (weave/thread/doc types) · the workflow loop + the stop-for-`go` rhythm · **§4 "Giving the AI the right context"** (the centerpiece: mental model → ctx → references/`load`/`load_when` → `requires_load` → how they combine → a worked end-to-end example) · staleness · tips. Opens with a "pick your surface" chooser linking to the two below.
- **`docs/EXTENSION_USER_GUIDE.md`** — banner back to the core · install · Claude-Code-vs-API-key paths · the Threads + Context panel · a button→action table for the whole loop · the **CONTEXT panel** in depth (7-symbol legend, toggles, open-on-click, `.loom/context-prefs.json`) · settings · troubleshooting.
- **`docs/CLI_USER_GUIDE.md`** — banner back to the core · the "two terminal roles" framing · install · `.mcp.json` + Claude Code approval · driving the loop via `do-next-step` · seeing context via the `📄` lines · an accurate `loom` command reference · troubleshooting.

Each surface guide is short and defers all concepts to the core — zero duplication, single source for the 70%.

**Accuracy calls worth flagging** (I grounded everything in the live `package.json` / CLI source / pipeline design, not the older reference docs, several of which are stale):
- I describe the **new 7-symbol CONTEXT panel**, not the README's old "Pinned/Opt-in" view (that's the pre-P3 panel).
- The CLI guide does **not** mention `loom ai respond` — that command isn't in the current CLI. I framed the CLI honestly as setup + inspection + CRUD, with **Claude Code (MCP)** as where the AI actually runs.
- There's no "Generate Idea" button in the extension, so I describe the real path (Weave Idea + Refine Idea, or Promote a chat). 
- Followed your three: abstract-then-example in §4, no image refs, split into the C structure.

These live in `docs/` (outside `loom/`), so they're plain files — not Loom-managed docs.

Next: waiting for direction — want me to add a link to these from the repo `README.md` / the extension README, reconcile the stale `vscode-commands-reference.md` + `cli-commands-reference.md` (separate cleanup), or are we good?

## Rafa:

- add a link to these from the repo `README.md` / the extension README
- update `vscode-commands-reference.md` & `cli-commands-reference.md`
- bump extension 0.7.0
- update main README and extension README
- commit ALL, push to main
