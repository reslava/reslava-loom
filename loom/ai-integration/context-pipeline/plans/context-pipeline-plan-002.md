# Context Pipeline — Phase 2: load / load_when filtering

## Goal

Phase 2 of the Unified Context Pipeline: activate reference-doc context filtering inside the pure assembler. Add the `load` axis (`always` / `by-request`) and the `load_when: [mode…]` filter — both absorbed from the now-archived `load-when` and `reference-load-context` threads (Option C, 2026-05-27) — and wire step 3 of the assembler algorithm. Reference-doc filtering ships now; ctx-doc filtering follows the inert getState ctx-load gap (out of scope). VS Code tree-view UX (References section, 📌 icon, tooltip tags) is Phase 3, not here.

## Steps

| Done | # | Step | Files touched | Blocked by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🔳 | 1 | Add a `load` field (values "always" / "by-request", default "by-request") and widen the reserved `loadWhen` to `load_when: string[]` on the ReferenceDoc entity in packages/core; absent load_when means all modes | — | — |
| 🔳 | 2 | Parse and serialize `load` + `load_when` in packages/fs frontmatter (canonical key order, array handling, back-compat defaults for docs missing the fields) | — | — |
| 🔳 | 3 | Implement the assembler filter (assembleContext step 2-3): auto-load only always refs, exclude by-request refs from auto-load (still includable via requires_load), and drop always refs whose `load_when` omits the current mode — excluded refs get reason `load_when-filter`; ctx docs stay implicitly always/all-modes; `refine` mode filters by the target's type per design §8 | — | — |
| 🔳 | 4 | Extend tests/context-assembler.test.ts with the load/load_when matrix: by-request excluded from auto-load yet present via requires_load; always+load_when:[design] in design mode included but excluded (load_when-filter) in implementing; always with no load_when present in every mode | — | — |
| 🔳 | 5 | Update loom/refs/loom-context-pipeline-reference.md phasing table to mark P2 shipped + note the absorption, then run ./scripts/build-all.sh and ./scripts/test-all.sh green | — | — |
