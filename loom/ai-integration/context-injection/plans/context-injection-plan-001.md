# Context Injection — Implementation Plan (MVP scope only)

## Goal

Lock in the MVP-scope context-injection rule ("first chat-reply in a thread loads thread context") in both `CLAUDE.md` surfaces, and confirm the MCP tools surface enough metadata for the AI to apply the rule correctly. Defer the delta-only optimization to a post-MVP plan.

## Phases

| Phase | Scope | Steps |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 | CLAUDE.md rule audit | 1 |
| 2 | MCP tool metadata check | 2–3 |

---

## Phase 1 — CLAUDE.md rule audit

| Done | # | Step | Files touched | Blocked by |
|------|---|------|---------------|------------|
|      | 1 | Audit the chat-reply context-injection rule in both `CLAUDE.md` and `LOOM_CLAUDE_MD` template. Confirm the three cases are documented (first reply → load + emit; subsequent same thread → tool-call line only; after refine/generate → re-load). Confirm the rule explicitly states the "is context already in transcript?" decision is AI-side, not server-side. Reconcile any drift between the two files. | `CLAUDE.md`, `packages/app/src/installWorkspace.ts` | — |

---

## Phase 2 — MCP tool metadata check

| Done | # | Step | Files touched | Blocked by |
|------|---|------|---------------|------------|
|      | 2 | Inspect `loom_append_to_chat` and `loom_generate_chat_reply` tool handlers. Confirm the response includes `threadId` (or enough information for the AI to derive it) so the AI can call `loom://thread-context/{weave}/{threadId}` on the first reply. If the threadId is not exposed, add it to the response shape. | `packages/mcp/src/tools/appendToChat.ts`, `packages/mcp/src/tools/generateChatReply.ts` (paths approximate; verify in audit) | 1 |
|      | 3 | If step 2 changes a tool response shape, update the matching MCP integration test to assert the new field. Run `cd packages/vscode && npm run package` to confirm the bundle still compiles. | `packages/mcp/tests/integration.test.ts` | 2 |

**Notes:**
- Steps 2 and 3 may turn out to be no-ops if the threadId is already in the response. If so, mark them done with a one-line "verified, no change needed" note.
- The post-MVP delta-only optimization (server-side session state, transcript awareness) lives in a future `context-injection-plan-002`. Do not start it from this plan.

## Out of scope

- Server-side `loadedContexts` / `contextDirty` tracking — explicitly deferred per `mvp-scope` and the design's `### Where this state lives` section.
- Bundling thread context into the chat-reply tool response (vs returning threadId only) — call this out as an open decision in step 2; if it requires architectural change, defer to plan-002.
