# CHAT

## Rafa:

### ctx.md are not showed in tree
`loom/ctx.md` 
`loom/vscode-extension/ctx.md`

### Fix Delete Thread
Its not working

### Right mouse menu options in special tree folders
- Chats, {weave}/Chats, {weave}/{thread}/Chats -> create chat. note: we could delete toolbar weave chat butoon
- Context, {weave}/Context -> create context
- References -> create reference. Ask user, reference Title, Description. AI should read loom weaves and even project codebase searching info to create the reference doc. For example, user ask: Create reference -> Title: Architecture -> Description: define project architecture with diagram, layers, DI, stack used..."

What you think?



## AI:

Three separate topics — let me take each in turn.

---

### 1. ctx.md not shown in tree

The tree provider categorises docs into the folder nodes it knows about (Chats, Plans, Done, etc.). `ctx` is simply not in that list — it was added to the domain after the initial tree design. Same gap exists for `reference` docs.

Fix: the tree needs two new folder nodes per thread: **Context** (holds `*-ctx.md`) and **References** (holds `*-reference.md`). At weave level, a **Context** node would surface weave-ctx docs (e.g. `loom/vscode-extension/ctx.md`). At workspace level, it could surface `loom/ctx.md`.

Worth noting: the global `loom/ctx.md` sits outside any weave, so it needs a dedicated root-level node or a "Workspace" folder at the top of the tree.

---

### 2. Delete Thread not working

Before I can say anything useful here I need to look at the code. Can you tell me:
- What happens when you invoke it? (error message, nothing, partial deletion?)
- Which command is it — `loom.deleteThread` in the command palette, or a tree context menu item?

That will let me go straight to the right place in `packages/vscode/`.

---

### 3. Right-click menus on special folders

The proposal is clean and I like the direction. My read on each:

**Chats folder → Create Chat** — yes, this is the right place. Removing the toolbar button for weave-level chat creation makes sense once the folder context menu covers the same action; one entry point is less noisy than two.

**Context folder → Create Ctx** — straightforward, matches the pattern. The generated ctx would need scope awareness: thread-level ctx vs. weave-level ctx vs. global. The folder node already carries that scope implicitly, so the command can infer it.

**References folder → Create Reference** — this is the most interesting one, and also the heaviest. What you're describing is essentially a **generate_reference** flow: user gives title + description, AI reads loom docs + codebase, produces a structured reference doc. A few questions before I'd call this settled:

1. Where does the reference live? `loom/refs/` for global ones, `loom/{weave}/{thread}/refs/` for thread-local? The folder node in the tree should answer this by its location.
2. The AI-read step — is this a sampling call (MCP `loom_generate_*` pattern) or a guided prompt that Claude Code runs interactively? The former keeps it fully in-extension; the latter requires the user to be in a Claude Code session.
3. References are `requires_load` citation targets — should the generated doc auto-wire itself into `requires_load` of the parent thread's idea/design, or is that a manual step?

The ctx + reference tree gap (items 1 and 3) are connected: both need new folder nodes and new `create` commands. I'd bundle them into a single small tree-enhancement task. Delete Thread and the context menus feel like separate tasks.

**Overall verdict:** solid set of improvements. The reference creation with AI assist is the only one with open design questions — the rest are clear enough to plan immediately. Want me to draft a plan that groups them?

### 2

Delete thread and delete weave are not working. No message. It doesn't matter if they are empty or have content. I tested again with `loom/weave-test/thread-test`

### 3
1. reference docs are only global and lives in `loom/refs/`
2. pros and cons? workflow suggestions?
3. `requires_load` should be filled manually launched by button of right mouse option with extension help showing `loom/refs/` docs to multiple pick. Suggestions?



## AI:

### 2 — Delete Thread / Delete Weave — root cause found

`packages/vscode/src/commands/deleteItem.ts` lines 24–26:

```ts
// BUG — 'weaves' does not exist
await fs.remove(path.join(workspaceRoot, 'weaves', node.weaveId, node.threadId));
await fs.remove(path.join(workspaceRoot, 'weaves', node.weaveId));
```

Every other command that touches the loom directory uses `'loom'` — see `archiveItem.ts:16,21` for the correct pattern. The delete silently removes nothing because the path doesn't resolve to anything real. Fix: replace both `'weaves'` with `'loom'`.

Also flagging: `diagnostics.ts:35` has the same stale `'weaves'` string — `path.join(workspaceRoot, 'weaves', weaveResult.id)`. Same one-char fix there.

Both fixes are trivial. Ready to apply on `go`.

### 3 — Reference creation design

**3.1 — Global only, `loom/refs/`** — confirmed, clean. No ambiguity about location; the References tree node always maps to that one directory.

**3.2 — Sampling vs. interactive**

| | Sampling (MCP `loom_generate_reference`) | Interactive (Claude Code session) |
|---|---|---|
| **Stays in-extension** | ✅ — no Claude Code session needed | ❌ — user must be in Claude Code |
| **Codebase access** | Limited — only what we explicitly load into the MCP prompt | Full — AI can freely browse any file |
| **Output quality** | Good for focused reference docs; capped by what we pass it | Richer, especially for architecture diagrams or cross-cutting patterns |
| **Complexity** | Same pattern as `loom_generate_idea` / `loom_generate_design` — already wired | Nothing to build; user kicks it off manually |

**Recommendation:** follow the established `create_*` / `generate_*` split already in the codebase.

1. `loom_create_reference` — creates the file with title + description in frontmatter, empty body. Always works.
2. `loom_generate_reference` — if sampling is available in the client, call it after create to fill the body: it gets the title + description + a curated set of loaded docs (weave ideas, designs, ctx) as context. If sampling is unavailable, open the created file and let the user fill it (or hand off to Claude Code).

The UI flow: Right-click References → Create Reference → QuickInput for title + description → create → generate (if sampling available, else open file). User never needs to know which path ran.

**3.3 — `requires_load` picker**

Proposed command: `loom.addRequiresLoad`
- Triggered from right-click on any idea/design/plan tree node → "Add References…"
- Shows a multi-select QuickPick listing every `loom/refs/*.md` doc (display: title, detail: filename)
- On confirm: calls `loom_update_doc` to patch the `requires_load` array in the selected doc's frontmatter (merge, no duplicates)
- The References folder node could also carry this as a context menu option so the user can manage it from there

This is clean and keeps the extension as the UI layer over MCP — no direct file editing.

---

**Grouping suggestion:**

| Task | Scope |
|---|---|
| Fix delete thread/weave + diagnostics path | Tiny bug fix — do now |
| Add ctx + reference nodes to tree | Tree enhancement — small |
| Right-click context menus (Chats, Context, References) | Medium — needs new commands + package.json menu entries |
| `loom_create_reference` + `loom_generate_reference` (MCP side) | Medium — new MCP tools |
| `loom.addRequiresLoad` picker | Small — new command, calls existing `loom_update_doc` |

Want me to start with the delete fix and draft a plan for the rest?

## Rafa:

Do delete fix
Create plan for the rest

## AI:

Delete fix applied — two files, two lines:

- `packages/vscode/src/commands/deleteItem.ts:24,26` — `'weaves'` → `'loom'`
- `packages/vscode/src/diagnostics.ts:35` — `'weaves'` → `'loom'`

Plan created: `loom/vscode-extension/vscode-new-fixes/plans/vscode-new-fixes-plan-001.md` (`pl_01KR119TRV94QJF6FG6GM4BB08`)

5 steps:
1. Add Context + References folder nodes to tree
2. Right-click menus on Chats / Context / References folder nodes
3. `loom_create_reference` MCP tool
4. `loom_generate_reference` MCP tool (sampling)
5. `loom.addRequiresLoad` command + QuickPick

Ready to start Step 1 on `go`.

## Rafa:

Do 1-5

## AI:

All 5 steps implemented and plan auto-completed. Here's what changed:

---

### Step 1 — Thread-level Context section (`treeProvider.ts`)

- `getThreadChildren` now adds a **Context** folder node for thread-level `*-ctx.md` docs (reads from `thread.allDocs`).
- `createChatsSection` updated to carry `weaveId`/`threadId` so the Create Chat context menu knows its scope. All call sites updated.

### Step 2 — Right-click menus + toolbar cleanup (`package.json`, `extension.ts`)

New context menu items:
- `chats-section` → **Weave Chat** (`loom.chatNew`)
- `ctx-section` → **Refresh Context** (`loom.refreshCtx`) — calls `loom_refresh_ctx` for weave/thread, `loom_generate_global_ctx` for global
- `refs-section` → **Create Reference** (`loom.createReference`)
- `idea` / `design` / `plan` → **Add References…** (`loom.addRequiresLoad`)

Toolbar: **removed** the `loom.chatNew` button — context menu on the Chats folder replaces it.

Three new commands registered: `loom.createReference`, `loom.refreshCtx`, `loom.addRequiresLoad`.

### Step 3 — `loom_create_reference` MCP tool (`packages/mcp/src/tools/createReference.ts`)

Creates `loom/refs/{slug}-reference.md` with correct frontmatter (`type: reference`, `slug`, optional `description`). Returns `{ id, filePath, slug }`.

### Step 4 — `loom_generate_reference` MCP tool (added to `generate.ts`)

If sampling is available: loads optional thread context + extra context docs, generates reference body, saves it into the doc from step 3. Falls back silently if sampling unavailable. The VS Code `createReference` command chains both tools automatically when AI is configured.

### Step 5 — `loom.addRequiresLoad` command (`packages/vscode/src/commands/addRequiresLoad.ts`)

- Right-click an idea/design/plan → **Add References…**
- Multi-select QuickPick listing all `loom/refs/*.md` (title + filename)
- On confirm: calls `loom_update_doc` with merged `requires_load` array

`loom_update_doc` was also extended to accept an optional `requires_load: string[]` parameter.

---

Also updated: `loom/ctx.md` and `CLAUDE.md` — vision/workflow refs now point to `vision-reference.md` / `workflow-reference.md`.

## Rafa:

All working. Need some tweak:

### chat issue
in folders without chats subfolder there is no way to create a chat.
Solution: when 
- loom install: create special folders in loom: 
  - .archive, 
  - chats
  - refs
- create weave, create {weave}/chats
- create thread, create {weave}/{thread}/chats

### reference docs
add delete, rename, archive

## AI:

### Chat issue — missing chats dir

The real problem: `chats-section` only appears in the tree when there are already chat docs. If the dir doesn't exist, the Chats folder node is never rendered, so there's no right-click entry point.

Two-part fix:

**Part A — Ensure dirs on create/install:**
- `loom install` / `installWorkspace.ts` → create `loom/chats/`, `loom/refs/`, `loom/.archive/`
- `loom.weaveCreate` → also create `{weave}/chats/`
- `loom.threadCreate` → also create `{weave}/{thread}/chats/`

**Part B — Always render Chats folder nodes (even when empty):**
- `getWeaveChildren` — always push `createChatsSection([], weave.id)` regardless of `weave.chats.length`
- `getThreadChildren` — same, always push `createChatsSection([], weaveId, thread.id)`
- `getRootChildren` — always push global Chats section

Part B alone solves the immediate UX problem with no install changes required. Part A is hygiene so the dirs exist on disk from day one and don't confuse git or the file watcher.

---

### Reference docs — delete / rename / archive

The existing `loom.delete`, `loom.rename`, `loom.archive` commands already handle weave/thread/idea/design/plan/chat/done/ctx — just not `reference`. Fix: extend the `when` clauses in `package.json` to include `reference`.

Current edit group in package.json:
```json
"when": "... viewItem =~ /^(weave|thread|idea|design|plan|chat|done|ctx|loose)/"
```

Add `reference` to each of those patterns. The underlying command handlers already go through `loom_rename` / `loom_archive` / `fs.remove` — they use `node.doc._path` which is set on all doc nodes including reference nodes, so no handler changes needed.

---

Both are small changes. Want me to do them?

## AI:

Done — two fixes applied.

### Chat issue

- `createChatsSection` now always renders (with `TreeItemCollapsibleState.None` when empty, `Collapsed` when it has children) — right-click Create Chat works even on empty folders.
- `getWeaveChildren` and `getThreadChildren` always push the Chats section regardless of chat count.
- Global Chats section at root also always rendered.
- `loom.weaveCreate` → creates `{weave}/chats/` on disk.
- `loom.threadCreate` → creates `{weave}/{thread}/chats/` on disk.
- `installWorkspace.ts` → `loom install` now creates `loom/chats/`, `loom/refs/`, `loom/.archive/` upfront.

### Reference docs — delete / rename / archive

`package.json` when clauses updated — `reference` added to:
- `loom.markDone` / `loom.markActive`
- `loom.rename`
- `loom.archive`
- `loom.delete`

No handler changes needed — `deleteItem.ts`, `archiveItem.ts`, `rename.ts` all use `node.doc._path` which is set on reference nodes.
