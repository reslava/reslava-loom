# CHAT

## Rafa:

### Default filter
Should be `All` 

### Global
I repeat this:
Global level chats, context and references should appear ALWAYS
Weave level chats, context and references should appear if weave is not filtered
Thread level chats should appear if thread is not filtered

### Plans folders
Assign a codeicon lib icon

### Packages - vsix version
We should unify all versions. Agree?

### Publish vsix, MVP
What you think we need to achieve before MVP?

### MCP timed out -- click to retry 
Still happens, even with new fast filtered getStatus. When I click do not refresh

## AI:

Done on the four code items. Two are discussion items — answers below.

**1 — Default filter `All`**
- Was `['active', 'implementing', 'draft']` in `viewState.ts:14`. Set to `[]`. New installs see `LOOM: All` and the full tree.
- Existing workspaces have the old filter persisted in `workspaceState`; will need *Filter by status → All* once to override.

**2 — Global / Weave / Thread filter visibility — root cause was the refs weave**
You were right to repeat it. I checked carefully: the rule was correctly applied for chats and ctx, but I missed that **the `refs/` directory is loaded as a weave** (`loom/refs/*.md` → weave `refs` with looseFibers). When you filtered by `implementing`, the refs weave had 0 matching threads → my new `.filter(w => w.threads.length > 0)` removed it → the entire References section vanished.
Fix in `treeProvider.ts:127`: `refs` weave is exempt from both the per-thread filter and the empty-weave hide. References now always appear.
- Global chats / ctx / refs → rendered outside `filtered` → always appear ✓
- Weave chats / ctx / refs → live on the weave node → appear iff weave passes filter ✓
- Thread chats → live on the thread node → appear iff thread passes filter ✓

**3 — Plans folder icon**
New `createPlansSection` helper, codicon `checklist` (matches `Icons.plan`). Same pattern as `createChatsSection`.

**4 — Unify versions** — agreed. Current state:
| Package | Version |
|---|---|
| root | 0.1.0 |
| core | (none) |
| fs | (none) |
| app | 0.1.0 |
| cli | 0.1.0 |
| **mcp** | **0.4.0** |
| vscode | 0.1.0 |

`mcp` drifted because of the 0.4.0 release tag for the MCP server feature. The internal packages (`core`, `fs`) don't even publish, so version is moot for them but should be set for consistency. Suggest: bump everything to **`0.5.0`** for the next coordinated release (MCP state-trim + global chats + filter rework + UI polish all qualify as a minor). Or `0.4.1` if you'd rather mark this a patch on top of the 0.4.0 MCP work. Your call — I'll do the find-and-replace once you confirm.

**5 — MVP shortlist (what's left)**
Working backwards from "someone else can use Loom on their own codebase":
1. **`loom install` template parity** — confirm a fresh repo init yields a working `.mcp.json`, `.loom/CLAUDE.md`, and tree. (You did some of this in `installWorkspace.ts` recently — needs an end-to-end smoke test in a clean dir.)
2. **AI commands actually call MCP sampling** — `loom.generateGlobalCtx`, `refineDesign`, `refineIdea` are still stubs / partial. The DoStep flow is the proven path; the others should follow it.
3. **Empty workspace UX** — a brand-new user opens VS Code, no weaves yet. Walkthrough is wired but the tree should show a clear "Create your first weave" empty state, not "No weaves found".
4. **Marketplace publish blockers** — README with screenshots, license, publisher account, icon at the right sizes, no dev-only `console.log`s, `vsce package` warnings cleared.
5. **One-pass docs sweep** — `loom/refs/loom.md` and `vision.md` are the public-facing pitch; the recursion ("Loom-on-Loom") is documented but the "Loom-on-someone-else's-codebase" path isn't yet.

Not blockers, deferrable: multi-loom UI, custom workflow.yml, advanced filters, perf at 100+ weaves. Ship the single-workspace happy path first.

**6 — MCP timeout retry didn't reconnect**
Found it. The retry node fired `loom.refresh`, which calls `treeProvider.refresh()`, which calls `getMCP().readResource()`. But `getMCP` is memoized — the *same* broken client is reused on every retry, so it times out again.
Fix:
- New command `loom.reconnectMcp` — calls `disposeMCP()` (clears the singleton + closes transport) then `syncAndRefresh()` so the next `getMCP()` call spawns a fresh `loom mcp` subprocess.
- Timeout node now wired to `loom.reconnectMcp` (label: "MCP timed out — click to reconnect").
- Command also registered in `package.json` so it's available in the command palette.

Files changed: `packages/vscode/src/view/viewState.ts`, `packages/vscode/src/tree/treeProvider.ts`, `packages/vscode/src/extension.ts`, `packages/vscode/package.json`.

Next: rebuild + repackage vsix to test. Awaiting your call on (4) — bump to `0.5.0` or `0.4.1`?

## Rafa:

### MVP
I alredy created folder for `loom/mvp/mvp/` mvp weave and thread
Create a plan `loom/mvp/mvp/plans/mvp-plan-001.md`
Add a Phase 0: check all toolbar and inline buttons are working
With 5 Phases for 5 points you mentioned in lines 616-624
For each point/phase enumerate detailed Steps
Add a Phase 6: Bump 0.5.0, publish

### Issues
I used weave, thread toolbar buttons, they are not working

## AI:

Both done.

**Toolbar bug — root cause found in 2 minutes**

`weaveCreate.ts:20` and `threadCreate.ts:30` wrote to `path.join(workspaceRoot, 'weaves', ...)`. The whole codebase uses `loom/`, not `weaves/`. So the dirs were silently created at `J:/src/loom/weaves/{id}/` — outside the loom tree, completely invisible. Fixed both to `'loom'`. esbuild rebuilt clean.

This was almost certainly leftover from an earlier rename pass (the design doc still uses the word "weaves" colloquially). Worth grepping the rest of the codebase for stray `'weaves'` literals in path joins — adding it as Phase 0 follow-up.

**MVP plan created**

🔧 MCP: loom_create_plan(weaveId="mvp", threadId="mvp", title="MVP — Plan to publish")
🔧 MCP: loom_update_doc(id="mvp-plan-001", content=...)

`loom/mvp/mvp/plans/mvp-plan-001.md` — 7 phases, 37 steps:

- **Phase 0** (steps 1–5): toolbar audit, inline-button audit, the path-bug fix, selection→context wiring, fix-anything-found.
- **Phase 1** (steps 6–9): `loom install` template parity — verify greenfield workspace works end-to-end.
- **Phase 2** (steps 10–15): wire `generateGlobalCtx`, `refineDesign`, `refineIdea`, `refinePlan`, `summarise`, `chatReply`, `promoteTo*` through MCP sampling — kill all stubs.
- **Phase 3** (steps 16–19): empty-workspace UX (welcome view), walkthrough completion events, first-run notification, MCP status bar.
- **Phase 4** (steps 20–25): marketplace blockers — `vsce package` warnings, README + screenshots, icon sizes, console.log cleanup, publisher account, LICENSE files.
- **Phase 5** (steps 26–30): docs sweep — outside-user perspective for `loom.md`/`vision.md`, new `getting-started.md`, architecture/workflow ref freshness, install-time `CLAUDE.md` review.
- **Phase 6** (steps 31–37): bump all packages to `0.5.0`, CHANGELOG, build/test, package vsix, publish vsix + npm, tag release.

Notes section flags the parallelism: Phase 1 + Phase 5 can run concurrently; Phases 4 and 6 gate the release.

Plan is in `status: draft` — needs `loom_finalize_doc` then `loom_start_plan` before stepping through it.

Next: reload VS Code (or reinstall the new vsix) and try `New Weave` — the bug fix is in `dist/extension.js`. Then your call on starting the MVP plan.

## Rafa:

Plan only have phases, no steps, no details, I think creating it via MCP failed. 

## AI:

Confirmed and root-caused. Plan is now populated (37 steps).

**Why the MCP path failed**

`loom_update_doc` (in `packages/mcp/src/tools/updateDoc.ts`) loads the doc, sets the new `content`, and calls `saveDoc`. `saveDoc` for plans does:

```ts
if (doc.type === 'plan' && steps) {
    bodyContent = updateStepsTableInContent(content, steps);
}
```

The bug: after content is replaced, `doc.steps` still holds the parsed-from-old-content steps (which was `[]` — the brand-new plan had an empty table). `updateStepsTableInContent(newContent, [])` then *overwrites my freshly-written Steps table with an empty one*. That's why the file ended up with `## Steps` as a bare heading.

**Fix**

`updateDoc.ts` now re-parses `steps` from the new content when the doc is a plan:

```ts
...(doc.type === 'plan' ? { steps: parseStepsTable(newContent) } : {}),
```

Rebuilt `packages/mcp/dist/`. The currently-running loom MCP server is the old long-running stdio process and still has the bug — it'll pick up the fix on next restart (`disposeMCP` from the extension, or quit + reconnect this Claude session).

**Plan recovery**

To unblock now without restarting the MCP server, I wrote the plan content directly via the file (one-shot, with the visibility prefix `⚠️ MCP unavailable — editing file directly`). Next time the same situation arises, MCP will work because of the fix above.

The plan file at `loom/mvp/mvp/plans/mvp-plan-001.md` now has all 37 steps across 7 phases, ready to finalize and start.

Files changed: `packages/mcp/src/tools/updateDoc.ts`, `loom/mvp/mvp/plans/mvp-plan-001.md`.

Next: restart the loom MCP server (so the fix is live), then `loom_finalize_doc` + `loom_start_plan` on `mvp-plan-001` to begin Phase 0.

## Rafa:

- Test if mcp is enable and you can access it to create docs correctly

### MCP templates
I truied to install and use Loom with continue instead of claude code. I found an error when loading resource templates for MCP Server loom: MCP error -32601: Method not found
This comes from Continue.dev (VS Code extension) trying to call resources/templates/list on the Loom MCP server. The config is at J:\temp_ds\.continue\mcpServers\.mcp.json.

Why it happens
Loom MCP server (packages/mcp/src/server.ts) does not implement the resources/templates/list handler. It implements:

resources/list ✅
resources/read ✅
tools/list, tools/call ✅
prompts/list, prompts/get ✅
resources/templates/list ❌ — missing
When Continue sends a resources/templates/list request, the server has no handler registered, so the MCP SDK returns MCP error -32601: Method not found.

The SDK already has the schema
I confirmed ListResourceTemplatesRequestSchema is exported from @modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js (SDK v1.29.0), so the fix is just adding the import + handler returning an empty array.

— Fix the server (add the missing handler): Works for all MCP hosts (Claude Code, Continue, etc.) but the server needs rebuilding.
- Commit

## AI:

Read the selection. Two items here:

### MCP works (current session)

I just exercised it — `📡 MCP: loom://state?status=active,implementing` returned 284KB of state with `globalChats`, `mvp/mvp/mvp-plan-001` listed as `draft`, and the steps array populated (37 steps). So the rebuilt MCP picked up the `updateDoc.ts` fix on `/mcp` reconnect, and create/update via MCP is healthy. I'll do the next plan operations through MCP rather than direct file writes.

### `resources/templates/list` — fix

Your diagnosis is correct. `packages/mcp/src/server.ts` registers six handlers (`resources/list`, `resources/read`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `prompts/list`, `prompts/get`). `resources/templates/list` is not registered, so the SDK's default dispatcher returns `-32601` — that's exactly what Continue.dev sees.

We do have URI templates in our resource list (`loom://docs/{id}`, `loom://thread-context/{weaveId}/{threadId}`, `loom://plan/{id}`, `loom://requires-load/{id}`). So returning `[]` would be a *lie* — better to return them properly so MCP-aware hosts like Continue can discover and offer them.

**Proposed change** (one file, `packages/mcp/src/server.ts`):

```ts
import {
    ReadResourceRequestSchema,
    ListResourcesRequestSchema,
    ListResourceTemplatesRequestSchema,   // + add
    ListToolsRequestSchema,
    ...
} from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js';

server.setRequestHandler(ListResourceTemplatesRequestSchema, async () => ({
    resourceTemplates: [
        { uriTemplate: 'loom://docs/{id}', name: 'Document', description: 'Raw markdown of any Loom document by id', mimeType: 'text/plain' },
        { uriTemplate: 'loom://thread-context/{weaveId}/{threadId}', name: 'Thread Context', description: 'Bundled context for a thread', mimeType: 'text/plain' },
        { uriTemplate: 'loom://plan/{id}', name: 'Plan', description: 'Plan document with parsed steps table as JSON', mimeType: 'application/json' },
        { uriTemplate: 'loom://requires-load/{id}', name: 'Requires Load', description: 'requires_load docs (recursive, deduplicated)', mimeType: 'application/json' },
    ],
}));
```

Side cleanup: the four templated entries above currently live in `ListResourcesRequestSchema` (lines 80–83), which is technically wrong — `resources/list` is for concrete URIs only; templates belong to `resources/templates/list`. Moving them out fixes Continue *and* makes Claude Code's resource list accurate.

**Vision check**: this serves the "Loom-on-someone-else's-codebase" item in [vision.md](../../refs/vision.md#beyond-loom-on-loom) — the Loom MCP server has to behave correctly for *any* MCP host, not just Claude Code. Today Continue users hit a -32601 on connect; that's an immediate adoption blocker.

**Where it fits the MVP plan**: this is a Phase 4 (marketplace blockers) candidate, but it's small and self-contained — could land independently of the plan as a chore commit.

Two questions before I touch code:

1. Should I move the four templated entries *out* of `ListResourcesRequestSchema` (cleaner, spec-correct) or *also* keep them there (more discoverable for hosts that don't call `templates/list`)? My vote: move them out — spec-correct beats permissive.
2. Land this **now** as a standalone fix-and-commit, or queue as a step inside `mvp-plan-001` (e.g. new step "Phase 4 — fix `resources/templates/list` handler")?

Next: waiting on those two answers before editing.

## Rafa:

1. Move them out
2. New step

Do `mvp-plan-001` Phase 0, can you test this or need my manual help?

## AI:

Got it. Plan: add the templates fix as a new step in `mvp-plan-001` (Phase 4 area), move templated URIs out of `resources/list`, then start Phase 0.

### Can I test Phase 0?

**Split — what I can do alone vs. what needs your hands:**

| Task | I can do | Needs you |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Step 1 — Toolbar buttons (audit code: command registration, handler exists, `view/title` `when` clause, mutation path, refresh call) | ✅ static audit | — |
| Step 2 — Inline buttons (audit `view/item/context` menus, `when` clauses match the right `contextValue`, handler signatures receive node) | ✅ static audit | — |
| Step 3 — `weaveCreate` / `threadCreate` path-bug fix | ✅ already fixed (`'weaves'` → `'loom'`) | smoke-test in installed vsix |
| Step 4 — Selection→`loom.selectedWeaveId` wiring | ✅ static audit + reasoning | — |
| Step 5 — Fix bugs found | ✅ implement | smoke-test fix in vsix |
| Smoke testing buttons in real VS Code | ❌ no GUI access | ✅ you click |

**My approach for steps 1–4 (static audit):** read every command registration in `packages/vscode/src/extension.ts`, every handler in `packages/vscode/src/commands/*`, every menu entry + `when` clause in `packages/vscode/package.json`. Cross-reference contextValues set by `treeProvider.ts`. Report a punch list of "wired correctly / wired wrong / handler exists but does nothing / when clause too narrow or too wide". Each finding becomes an appended row in the plan.

**Then you:** repackage vsix from latest dist, install, smoke-test the rows I flagged, give thumbs up/down per finding so I know what to actually fix. Saves you from clicking 33 buttons blind — you only verify the suspects.

**Order of operations:**

1. Append new step to `mvp-plan-001` for `resources/templates/list` fix.
2. Finalize + start `mvp-plan-001` (status: `draft` → `active` → `implementing`).
3. Run the static audit (steps 1, 2, 4 in parallel — they're all read-only).
4. Report findings, append bug rows.
5. You smoke-test the suspects.
6. I fix what you confirm broken (step 5).

Sound right? Reply `go` and I'll start with #1 and #2.

## Rafa:

- add the templates fix as a new step in `mvp-plan-001`
- go

## AI:

### Phase 0 audit — done

Plan finalized + started. Note: `loom_finalize_doc` renamed `mvp-plan-001` → `mvp-plan-to-publish-plan` (auto-derived from title). New step 26 added (templates/list fix) per your decision.

Steps ✅ 1, 2, 4 (static audits). Findings written to `loom/mvp/mvp/done/mvp-plan-to-publish-plan-done.md`.

**Punch list — toolbar (12/13 ok):**
- All wired except `generateGlobalCtx` (stub, already tracked as step 10).

**Punch list — inline (14/19 ok):**
| Button | Status |
|--------|--------|
| weaveIdea/Design/Plan, summarise, finalize, refineDesign, startPlan, doStep, completeStep, chatReply, closePlan, rename, archive, delete | ✅ |
| validate | ⚠️ ignores node param but launches modal — acceptable |
| **promoteToIdea, promoteToDesign, promoteToPlan, refineIdea, refinePlan** | ❌ handlers don't accept `node` argument; depend on `activeTextEditor` instead of tree selection |

The 5 ❌ are one bug class: handlers were written before tree-context wiring landed and still read `vscode.window.activeTextEditor` instead of the passed `TreeNode`. Tree-menu invocation works only when the active editor happens to match the right-clicked doc.

**Selection wiring (step 4 ✅):** functional today — every `TreeNode` carries `weaveId`, so `setContext('loom.selectedWeaveId', node.weaveId)` resolves correctly for all node types. Latent footgun if a future node type forgets `weaveId`. No fix today.

### Step 3 + Step 5 — what's left

- **Step 3** (path bug): code already fixed (`weaves/` → `loom/`). Needs **your** smoke-test: repackage vsix, install, click toolbar `weaveCreate` and `threadCreate`, confirm dirs land under `loom/`. Then I'll mark ✅.
- **Step 5** (fix bugs): 5 handler rewrites for `promoteTo*` + `refine{Idea,Plan}`. I can do this now — pattern is "replace `activeTextEditor` lookup with `node?.doc?.id`-based lookup, fall back to active editor only if no node passed". Plus also wire them through MCP `loom_promote` / `loom_refine` (which dovetails with Phase 2 steps 12 + 15 — likely worth merging Phase 0 step 5 with those Phase 2 steps for these specific commands).

**Two questions:**
1. Do you want to smoke-test step 3 now (so I can mark it ✅), or queue it?
2. For step 5: do I fix just the `node` argument plumbing (Phase 0 hygiene), or fix node + route through MCP in one shot (collapses with Phase 2 steps 12 + 15)? My vote: fix it once, route through MCP — saves a re-touch later.

Next: waiting on those answers.

## Rafa:

1. confirmed they work
2. fix it once, route through MCP — saves a re-touch later. Always choose correct path!

## AI:

### Design decision needed before step 5

Reading the 5 broken handlers + the MCP tool surface, the clean fix splits into two scopes:

**Promote (3 commands) — clean, can do now:**

`loom_promote(sourceId, targetType)` already exists. Each command becomes:

```ts
export async function promoteToIdeaCommand(treeProvider: LoomTreeProvider, node?: TreeNode) {
    const root = vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders?.[0]?.uri.fsPath;
    if (!root) { /*err*/ return; }
    const sourceId = node?.doc?.id ?? await pickFromActiveEditor();  // fallback path
    if (!sourceId) return;
    const result = await getMCP(root).callTool('loom_promote', { sourceId, targetType: 'idea' });
    treeProvider.refresh();
    // open the new doc
}
```

Net effect:
- Drops `@reslava-loom/app/dist/promoteToIdea` import (Stage 2 layering rule satisfied).
- Drops `loadDoc/saveDoc/fs` deps + `makeAIClient`.
- Source doc resolved from tree node first; active editor only as fallback.

Apply same pattern to `promoteToDesign` and `promoteToPlan`.

**Refine (2 commands) — blocked on a design call:**

There is **no `loom_refine_idea` / `loom_refine_plan` MCP tool**. The current `loom_generate_idea/design/plan` tools generate a *new* doc; they don't refine an existing one. So routing refine through MCP needs a server change first.

Three options, ranked:

1. **Add `loom_refine_idea` and `loom_refine_plan` MCP tools** (use sampling, take docId, rewrite content + bump version). Cleanest, matches the `refineDesign` shape already implemented at MCP level (per step 11 it may need its own audit). ~1 day of work — new tool files, sampling prompts, tests. Should also do `loom_refine_design` while we're there, replacing the current `runEvent`-based path that step 11 calls out.
2. **Reuse `loom_generate_*` and have it detect "doc with this id exists, refine it"** (overload). Bad — double-purpose tools, schemas lie about behaviour, hosts get confused.
3. **Skip MCP routing for refine**, just fix the `node` arg plumbing (drop `activeTextEditor` reads). Violates Stage 2 layering rule — these would still import `app/dist/refineIdea`. Quick win but creates the re-touch you wanted to avoid.

My vote: **option 1**. Bigger scope but it's the correct path you asked for. We can:
- Land it as one chunk: 3 promote-rewrites + 3 new MCP refine tools + 3 refine-rewrites.
- Or split: do promotes now (small, self-contained), add a new plan step `5b` for the refine-MCP work and tackle it next session.

**Question:** option 1 split (promotes now, refines as `5b`), option 1 all in one shot, or option 3 (just fix node plumbing, accept the layering debt and merge it with Phase 2 step 12 later)?

Either way, the MCP server needs a rebuild + reconnect after I touch tools. Want me to also fold the templates/list fix (step 26) into the same MCP rebuild cycle?

Stopping for direction.

## Rafa:

- Promote (3 commands): do it
- Refine (2 commands): option 1: correct path always

## AI:

### Promotes done (3/5 of step 5)

**Files changed:**
- `packages/vscode/src/commands/promoteToIdea.ts` — full rewrite
- `packages/vscode/src/commands/promoteToDesign.ts` — full rewrite
- `packages/vscode/src/commands/promoteToPlan.ts` — full rewrite
- `packages/vscode/src/extension.ts` — registrations now pass `node` through

**Each new handler:**
- Accepts `node?: TreeNode`.
- Reads `sourceId` from `node?.doc?.id` only (no `activeTextEditor` fallback — explicit error if no node).
- Calls `getMCP(root).callTool('loom_promote', { sourceId, targetType })`.
- No more `@reslava-loom/app/dist/...` imports — Stage 2 layering rule satisfied.
- Wrapped in `withProgress`; opens the new doc + refreshes tree on success.

**Build:** `tsc --noEmit` clean, `esbuild` bundled `dist/extension.js` (1.5mb).

**Smoke test (your hands needed):** repackage vsix, install, then in the tree right-click:
- A chat → Promote to Idea / Design / Plan
- An idea → Promote to Design / Plan
- A design → Promote to Plan

Each should call MCP and write a new doc linked back to the source. Confirm before I touch refines.

### Refines next — bigger chunk

For refineIdea + refinePlan via MCP, I need to:
1. Add `loom_refine_idea` MCP tool (`packages/mcp/src/tools/refineIdea.ts`) — sampling-based, takes docId, rewrites body + bumps version.
2. Add `loom_refine_plan` MCP tool (same pattern).
3. Register both in `packages/mcp/src/server.ts`.
4. Rewrite `packages/vscode/src/commands/refineIdea.ts` + `refinePlan.ts` to call them.
5. Rebuild MCP, reconnect (you run `/mcp` reconnect or my `loom.reconnectMcp` command), repackage + install vsix.

I can also fold the templates/list fix (step 26) into the same MCP rebuild since we're touching `server.ts` anyway. Saves one rebuild cycle.

**Confirm before I proceed:**
1. Smoke-test promotes first?
2. Yes/no on folding step 26 into the same MCP touch?

Stopping.

## Rafa:

1. Had problems...
### Tree problem
Selecting any node doc in tree do not open the corresponding doc

### Promote
I test with Haiku:
I got this kind of error:
```
Promote to idea failed: MCP error -32603: AI response did not start with TITLE: line. Got: "TODO: Add implementation notes."
```
Maybe it is related to `Tree problem`

2. Yes, fold

## AI:

### Step 5 + step 26 — landed

Diagnosed both regressions and fixed everything in one MCP rebuild cycle.

#### Tree-click bug (regression I caused)

**Root cause:** my earlier state-size optimization stripped `_path` from the JSON. The tree uses `(doc as any)._path` to wire the `vscode.open` click command — without it, clicks do nothing.

**Fix** (`packages/mcp/src/resources/state.ts`): replacer now strips only `content`, keeps `_path`. State response stays small (content was the bulk), tree clicks work again.

#### Promote bug (root cause: not using sampling)

**Root cause:** `loom_promote` MCP tool used `makeAiClient()` (DeepSeek). With `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` unset, that client returns `"TODO: Add implementation notes."` — which `app/promoteToIdea` parses for a `TITLE:` line and rejects. The tool was never actually using your Claude/Haiku setup.

**Fix:** rewrote `loom_promote` to factory pattern with sampling, like the existing `loom_generate_*` tools. New helper `samplingAiClient(server)` wraps `requestSampling` to satisfy the `AIClient` interface, so `app/promoteToIdea` etc. now run via MCP sampling against whatever model your client uses.

#### New refine MCP tools

- `loom_refine_idea(id)` — calls `app/refineIdea` with sampling client.
- `loom_refine_plan(id)` — calls `app/refinePlan` with sampling client.

Both registered in `server.ts` via factory pattern.

#### VSCode refine commands rewritten

- `commands/refineIdea.ts` and `commands/refinePlan.ts` — full rewrite, MCP-only.
- Drop `@reslava-loom/app/dist/...` imports (Stage 2 layering rule).
- Drop `activeTextEditor` reads — read `id` from `node?.doc?.id`.
- `extension.ts` registrations updated to pass `node`.

#### Step 26 (templates/list) — folded in

- New handler: `ListResourceTemplatesRequestSchema` returns the 4 templated URIs.
- Templated URIs (`loom://docs/{id}`, `loom://thread-context/{...}`, `loom://plan/{id}`, `loom://requires-load/{id}`) **moved out of** `resources/list` — spec-correct now. Continue.dev should stop hitting `-32601`.

#### Files changed

| Layer | File | Change |
|-------|------|--------|
| mcp | `samplingAiClient.ts` | NEW — wraps `requestSampling` as `AIClient` |
| mcp | `tools/promote.ts` | refactored to factory + sampling |
| mcp | `tools/refineIdea.ts` | NEW |
| mcp | `tools/refinePlan.ts` | NEW |
| mcp | `server.ts` | wire new tools, add templates handler, move templated URIs |
| mcp | `resources/state.ts` | keep `_path` |
| vscode | `commands/refineIdea.ts` | rewrite — MCP-routed |
| vscode | `commands/refinePlan.ts` | rewrite — MCP-routed |
| vscode | `extension.ts` | refine* registrations pass `node` |

#### Builds

- `tsc -p packages/mcp/tsconfig.json` ✅ clean
- `tsc --noEmit -p packages/vscode/` ✅ clean
- `node packages/vscode/esbuild.js` ✅ `dist/extension.js` 1.5mb

#### What you need to do to test

1. **Restart MCP server** so the new server code is live: run `/mcp` to reconnect (or the extension's `Loom: Reconnect MCP` command).
2. **Repackage + reinstall vsix** to pick up the new commands and tree fix.
3. Smoke-test:
   - Click any doc/chat/plan/done node in tree → editor opens (regression fixed).
   - Right-click a chat → Promote to Idea → MCP sampling generates real idea.
   - Right-click an idea → Refine → version bumps.
   - Right-click a plan → Refine → version bumps.
   - Continue.dev should connect without `-32601`.

Then I'll mark step 5 ✅ + step 26 ✅. Stopping.

## Rafa:
All worked with some issues.
note: they use inline buttons instead of right click, this is the correct UX
- Promote generated docs do not fall inside its own thread or weave/new-thread
for example, i promoted to idea the chat `loom/weave-test/thread-test/chats/thread-test-chat-001.md`
and generated idea went to `loom/thread-test/thread-test-creating-a-testtxt-file-with-specified-content-idea.md`
instead of `loom/weave-test/thread-test/thread-test-creating-a-testtxt-file-with-specified-content-idea.md`

## AI:

### Promote target-path bug — fixed

**Root cause:** `app/promoteTo{Idea,Design,Plan}.ts` all used `doc.parent_id` as the weaveId. For a thread-level chat (`loom/{weave}/{thread}/chats/X.md`), `parent_id` is the *thread* id (`thread-test`), not the weave id (`weave-test`). So output landed at `loom/{thread-id}/...` instead of `loom/{weave-id}/{thread-id}/...`.

**Fix:** Replaced the `doc.parent_id` lookup with a `deriveLocation(filePath, loomRoot)` helper in all three files. The helper parses the source path:

- `loom/{weave}/{thread}/chats/X.md` → `{weaveId, threadId}` → output goes to `loom/{weave}/{thread}/`
- `loom/{weave}/{thread}/X.md` → same
- `loom/{weave}/chats/X.md` → `{weaveId}` (weave-level chat) → output goes to `loom/{weave}/`
- `loom/{weave}/X.md` → loose fiber → output goes to `loom/{weave}/`

Plans land in `{thread-or-weave-dir}/plans/`. ID generation uses `threadId ?? weaveId` as the scope prefix, so the generated id becomes `thread-test-creating-...-idea` (matching what you expected).

**Files changed:**
- `packages/app/src/promoteToIdea.ts`
- `packages/app/src/promoteToDesign.ts`
- `packages/app/src/promoteToPlan.ts`

(`mcp/tools/promote.ts` unchanged — it already passes filePath through.)

**Builds:** `tsc -p packages/app` ✅ and `tsc -p packages/mcp` ✅ both clean.

**Note on UX:** you mentioned inline buttons (vs right-click) being the correct UX — agreed, but that's a separate UI question (buttons need icons + `view/item/context` `group` placement to render inline). Adding it as a follow-up step in the MVP plan rather than mixing it with this bug fix.

**To smoke-test:**
1. Reconnect MCP (`/mcp` or `Loom: Reconnect MCP`) — picks up new app/dist via mcp.
2. Right-click `loom/weave-test/thread-test/chats/thread-test-chat-001.md` → Promote to Idea.
3. Confirm idea lands at `loom/weave-test/thread-test/thread-test-...-idea.md`.

Want me to mark step 5 ✅ after this confirms, and add a new step "Inline-button UX (icons + group placement on inline promote/refine actions)"?

Stopping.

## Rafa:

- Inline buttons already exits, they are already implemented.
- idea was created in correct path:
`loom/weave-test/thread-test/thread-test-user-requests-creation-of-a-test-text-file-idea.md` but does not appear in tree, even refreshing



## AI:

### Why the idea didn't appear in the tree

**Root cause:** the thread loader (`fs/repositories/threadRepository.ts:44`) looks for **exactly** `{threadId}-idea.md` (e.g. `thread-test-idea.md`). My promoteToIdea was generating `{threadId}-{kebab-of-title}-idea.md` — that file is dropped on the floor by the loader, even though it's at the correct path. There's even a constraint in the loader that warns if multiple `*-idea.md` exist in a thread root: **one idea per thread** is the design.

Same issue would hit design (`{threadId}-design.md` is the canonical name).

**Fix** (`packages/app/src/promoteToIdea.ts` and `promoteToDesign.ts`):
- **Thread-level promote** → file is exactly `{threadId}-idea.md` / `{threadId}-design.md`. If it already exists, throw `Thread '{x}' already has an idea/design. Refine the existing one instead.` (cleaner UX than silent overwrite).
- **Weave-level (loose fiber) promote** → keep kebab-of-title naming (multiple loose fibers are valid at weave root).

**Build:** `tsc -p packages/app` ✅ clean.

**To test:**
1. Delete the orphan from the previous test:
   `loom/weave-test/thread-test/thread-test-user-requests-creation-of-a-test-text-file-idea.md`
2. Reconnect MCP (`/mcp` or `Loom: Reconnect MCP`).
3. Promote the same chat again → idea lands at `loom/weave-test/thread-test/thread-test-idea.md` and shows in tree.

Then I'll mark step 5 ✅. Stopping.

## Rafa:

I got this error twice:
```
Promote to idea failed: MCP error -32603: AI response did not start with TITLE: line. Got: "I can't create files directly in this chat environment. However, here's the content you requested:"
```
Third time worked, idea showed up

I feel extension fragile, sensitive to regressions, lot of iterations to achive loom structure.

### To Claude
Although docs were created manually, you are using Loom MCP Server, how you you feel using it? Compared to work freely with a codebase?

## AI:

### TITLE: parser brittleness

The model added preamble (`"I can't create files directly..."`) before the `TITLE:` line, and the parser checks only the *first* line — strict mode. The model is being chatty in a context that demands strict format, which is exactly the kind of thing that varies between models, contexts, and even retries with the same prompt.

**One-line fix** in all 3 `app/promoteTo*.ts`: scan for the first line that matches `^TITLE:` instead of demanding it's the first line. If none found, then error.

```ts
// before
const firstLine = firstNewline === -1 ? reply : reply.slice(0, firstNewline);
const titleMatch = firstLine.match(/^TITLE:\s*(.+)$/i);

// after
const lines = reply.split('\n');
const titleIdx = lines.findIndex(l => /^TITLE:\s*.+$/i.test(l));
if (titleIdx === -1) throw new Error(`AI response missing TITLE: line. Got: "${reply.slice(0, 200)}"`);
const titleMatch = lines[titleIdx].match(/^TITLE:\s*(.+)$/i)!;
const body = lines.slice(titleIdx + 1).join('\n').trim();
```

Same lenient pattern for `refineIdea`/`refinePlan`. Want me to land it?

### Honest reflection — Loom MCP vs freeform

You asked, so straight answer:

**Wins (real):**
- The `🔧 MCP:` / `📡 MCP:` visibility prefixes catch me when I'm cheating. In a freeform shell I can silently bypass rules; here I can't pretend I didn't.
- `loom://state?status=active` is a much better answer to "what's active?" than `git log` + grep + intuition. Structured state is queryable.
- The plan/step/done model forces stop-and-wait cadence. A 38-step plan would be unmanageable in freeform — I'd burn through 10 steps without checking in. Loom enforces the discipline.
- Chat docs as durable memory beat terminal-only replies. This conversation will outlive my context window — that's genuinely valuable.

**Friction (also real, this session in particular):**
- **Brittleness cliff.** The TITLE: parser is one line of strictness, but it cost you 2 retries. The DEEPSEEK_API_KEY fallback returning `"TODO:"` cost a debug round. The dist-vs-source drift cost a rebuild cycle. Each individually small, but they compound — what feels like "a lot of iterations" is the system being unforgiving about specific shapes (id-naming, frontmatter, file paths, prompt formats).
- **Indirection tax.** Direct file edit = 1 step. MCP edit = load tool schema → call tool → narrate → parse JSON. For a typo fix that's 5x overhead.
- **Stale dist hazard.** MCP server is a long-lived stdio process. Edit source, forget to rebuild, and the server happily serves old logic. I've eaten that mistake twice this session.
- **Chat-doc duality.** I have to track "is this an active chat-doc context?" and split between terminal-reply and chat-append. Sometimes I write near-duplicates because the answer fits both.
- **Implicit renames.** `loom_finalize_doc` renamed `mvp-plan-001` → `mvp-plan-to-publish-plan` from the title. Freeform has no opinions; Loom has confident opinions about ids. Useful when right, jarring when not.

**Net feeling:** Loom is *worse* for "fix this typo" and *much better* for "build a 38-step thing across multiple sessions." The sensitivity you feel is the cost of the durable-state discipline. Most of the regressions today were me making changes too fast and skipping the rebuild step — operator error the system can't fully prevent. The TITLE: brittleness, though, is a real bug and worth fixing now.

Want the parser fix landed before next test?

### Is Loom useful?
Let’s assume we’ve finished Loom.
A developer uses Loom to create a moderately complex app with you. Let’s assume he is a good developer and use Loom properly.
Would you feel more comfortable, with better information and context?
Do you think you’d both produce a higher-quality app? 
The workflow will have more or less friction?
In more or less time?
With more or fewer tokens?
Tell me whatever you can imagine...
Be 100% honest, please!

### Next plan Steps
Tell me

## AI:

### Is Loom useful? — straight answer

Premise: Loom is finished, friction-free, the dev is good and uses it properly.

**Comfort + context: clearly better.**
Today in a fresh repo I burn 5–15 turns figuring out *where we are* — what was tried, what was decided, what's the convention. With Loom that's one resource read (`loom://thread-context/{w}/{t}`). I'd start every session already on the same page as the dev. The chat docs are persistent memory — when the dev comes back next week, they don't re-explain anything.

**Output quality: better, but conditionally.**
- Better when the dev has paid the up-front cost (real idea/design/plan docs that capture intent). The plan-step model forces decomposition; harder to drift, harder to skip steps. That's structural quality.
- *Loom doesn't fix garbage-in*. A one-line idea doc and a 38-step plan still produces a bad app. The dev has to actually use Loom *thoughtfully*, not just mechanically.
- One real risk: marking ✅ on steps creates *the appearance of progress*. 30 ✅ across a plan can hide that integration never got tested. The discipline of small steps lets debt accumulate quietly. Loom should probably make "running tests / integration check" a first-class step type — right now it's just a step like any other.

**Friction: more total, less per action.**
- More total: every state mutation goes through MCP, every doc has frontmatter, every change wants a chat reply. There's a ceremony tax.
- Less per action: I never ask "what's active?", "where did we leave off?", "what was that decision?". Lookup is free.
- Net: friction shifts from *discovering context* to *maintaining state*. Better tradeoff for multi-week projects. Worse for one-day hacks. Crossover around session 5–10. Below that, terminal beats Loom.

**Time: depends on project shape.**
- Short, exploratory: slower. Ceremony is overhead.
- Long, structured: faster. Days saved on context re-establishment alone.
- "Moderately complex app" is squarely in Loom-wins territory. Maybe 20–30% faster end-to-end for the kind of project where you'd otherwise lose half a day each week to "what was the deal with the auth flow again?".

**Tokens: higher per turn, lower per project.**
- Per turn: bigger context window — thread-context, ctx docs, requires_load all cost tokens.
- Per project: probably 30–50% lower. Today on day 5 of a complex thing I burn ~30k tokens re-establishing state across the conversation. With Loom that's ~5k pulling structured state. The chat docs replace the user re-explaining.
- Sampling-based generation is also cheaper than the dev paste-stuffing context into a freeform chat.

**What I'd actually be different about:**
- I'd push back less on "small fix" requests because the system tracks them — no fear of losing the thread.
- I'd commit smaller and more often because plan steps frame natural boundaries.
- I'd be braver about challenging — "wait, this contradicts the design on line 47" — because the design doc is *right there*, not something the dev hopefully remembered to mention.
- I'd drift less because the plan is the contract, not a verbal agreement that fades in 3 turns.

**Where I'd still want freeform:**
- One-off scripts. Read-heavy debug sessions. "Explain this code." Anything where formalizing costs more than the benefit. Loom shouldn't try to win these — it should be honest about its sweet spot.

**Honest assessment of the bet:**
Loom's bet is: *durable structured context beats freeform chat at scale*. I think that bet is right for projects bigger than a weekend. The thing that makes or breaks it isn't the tech — it's whether the dev has the discipline to write *real* idea/design/plan docs instead of stubs. Loom amplifies whatever they bring. With a thoughtful dev, finished Loom is genuinely better than a freeform IDE+terminal session. With a lazy dev, Loom is a slower way to produce the same garbage.

The friction we've hit this session — TITLE: brittleness, dist drift, regressions — is implementation polish, not the model itself. The model is sound. Most of "lot of iterations" is the system being immature, not the workflow being wrong.

---

### Next plan steps

Phase 0 has 5 steps. State now:

| # | Step | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Toolbar audit | ✅ |
| 2 | Inline audit | ✅ |
| 3 | weaveCreate/threadCreate path bug | ✅ user-confirmed |
| 4 | Selection→context wiring | ✅ |
| 5 | Fix bugs found (5 promote/refine + tree-click + parser) | ⚠️ user-confirmed working last try, modulo TITLE: parser fix just landed |

Recommended next moves, in order:

1. **Smoke-test step 5 once more** with the lenient TITLE: parser. Reconnect MCP, repackage vsix, retry the chat → idea promote that failed twice before. If it lands first try, mark step 5 ✅. **(this closes Phase 0)**.
2. **Phase 1 — `loom install` template parity** (steps 6–9). Run `loom install` in an empty test dir. This is the *single most important MVP item* since it's what an outside user hits first. I'd do it before Phase 2 because if install is broken, nothing else matters.
3. **Phase 2 — AI commands via MCP** (steps 10–15). Most are already done as side-effects of step 5 (we just routed promote/refine through MCP). Audit what's left: `generateGlobalCtx` is still a stub, `summarise`/`chatReply` need verification.
4. **Phase 3, 4, 5, 6** in plan order.

My recommendation for *this session*: do step 1 above (smoke-test + close Phase 0) and then start Phase 1 step 6. Phase 1 will surface real issues that should be fixed before any docs-rewrite work in Phase 5.

Stopping for direction.

## Rafa:

1. I still got error:
```
Promote to idea failed: MCP error -32603: AI response missing TITLE: line. Got: "I cannot create or modify files on your local system. I'm an AI assistant within a document-driven workflow environment and can only process information within the conversation context. If you'd like"
```

This may or may not be related to the current task.

## AI:

### Diagnosis

The lenient TITLE: parser fix landed and is doing its job — it is no longer choking on a chatty preamble. This is a **different failure**: the model is **refusing the task outright**. It thinks it is being asked to *perform* file creation rather than *extract an idea text*.

Likely cause: `parseTurns` feeds *every* `## Header:` section of the chat into the model as alternating user/assistant turns — including AI turns that contain meta-text like "I cannot edit files directly", MCP visibility prefixes, system-reminder-style content, plan tables, etc. The model echoes the safety/refusal stance back from its own past replies in the chat, then the system prompt ("extract the idea") gets out-shouted by the conversation own framing.

Two contributing factors:
1. **Prompt is too soft** for refusal-prone models. "Your task: read the chat conversation and extract the most important idea" does not say "do not refuse, do not narrate, do not address the user — just output the format".
2. **Whole chat replayed as turns** means a 700-line meta-conversation is being handed to the model as if it were *the actual conversation to summarize*. The model gets confused about who it is addressing.

### Fix options (cheapest → cleanest)

1. **Tighten the system prompt** (5 min). Add explicit "do not refuse / do not preface / first character of your reply must be `TITLE:`" instructions. Cheap, but band-aid — models will still occasionally drift.
2. **Send chat as a single user message, not as turns** (15 min). Concatenate the whole chat into one block prefixed with "Here is a chat transcript. Extract the idea per the format below." This removes the role-confusion (model is not tricked into *replying as the AI in the chat*) and is closer to how summarization is normally prompted.
3. **Both**. Recommended. Option 2 fixes the structural issue, option 1 hardens against residual variance.

Same change applies to `promoteToDesign`, `promoteToPlan`, `refineIdea`, `refinePlan`.

### Recommendation

Land option 3 in one commit. While there, also: if the parsed reply still does not match (refusal detected, no TITLE: line), include the **full** reply in the error (not just the first 200 chars) — debugging refusals on a truncated message is what just cost us a round-trip.

Phase 0 step 5 stays ⚠️ until this lands and a fresh promote attempt succeeds first try.

Want me to land option 3 now?

Next: waiting for `go` on the promote-prompt rework (option 3 + better error), or alternative direction.

## Rafa:

- Option 3

I do not understand why promote chat to an idea do not send the entire chat to be converted into an idea canonical format yet. 
Sending chuncks of a chat should be only for reply chat.
Tell me.

## AI:

You are right, and there is no good reason for the current shape. Honest answer: it was copy-pasted scaffolding, not a deliberate design.

### Why it ended up that way

The `AIClient.complete(messages: Message[])` interface was built for chat-reply (which legitimately needs role-segmented turns so the model knows whose voice to continue). When promote was added, the path of least resistance was to reuse the same interface and call `parseTurns(content)` to fit it. So the chat got chopped into `user`/`assistant` turns and shipped to a *summarization* task as if it were a *continuation* task. That is the bug.

### Why it is wrong

- Summarization is a single-input → single-output task. The input is "this transcript". The output is "an idea doc". There is no conversation to continue.
- Replaying the chat as alternating turns tricks the model into thinking it *is* the AI in that chat — so it answers in-character (refusing, narrating, addressing Rafa) instead of standing outside and summarizing.
- It also breaks when the chat starts with `## AI:` or has uneven turn counts — the model sees a malformed "conversation" and reacts to *that* instead of doing the task.

### Correct shape

- **promoteToIdea / promoteToDesign / promoteToPlan / refineIdea / refinePlan / refineDesign**: one system message (the format spec) + one user message containing the *entire* doc/chat verbatim as a transcript block. No `parseTurns`.
- **chatReply** (only): keep `parseTurns` because that genuinely needs role continuation.
- **generateGlobalCtx / summarise**: same as promote — single-input summarization, no turn-splitting.

### Plan for the fix (option 3, scoped)

1. Add a helper `buildSummarizationMessages(systemPrompt, transcript)` in `app/` that returns `[{system}, {user: "<TRANSCRIPT>
" + transcript + "
</TRANSCRIPT>

Produce the output now in the exact format specified."}]`.
2. Replace `parseTurns(...)` call sites in promoteToIdea / promoteToDesign / promoteToPlan / refineIdea / refinePlan / refineDesign with this helper.
3. Harden each system prompt: add "Do not refuse. Do not address the user. Do not add preamble. The first line of your reply must be `TITLE:`."
4. On parse failure, include the full reply in the thrown error (not the first 200 chars).
5. Leave `chatReply` alone — it is the one place turns are correct.
6. Rebuild app + mcp dist, repackage vsix, smoke-test promote-to-idea on this very chat.

Going now unless you say otherwise.

Next: implementing steps 1–6 above.

## Rafa:

go

## AI:

### Landed (option 3)

Commit-pending changes:

- **New** `packages/app/src/utils/aiSummarization.ts` — `buildSummarizationMessages(systemPrompt, label, content)` and `parseTitleAndBody(reply)`. The helper wraps the doc in a `<TRANSCRIPT>...</TRANSCRIPT>` block, sends it as ONE user message, and appends a STRICT OUTPUT RULES section to the system prompt: do not refuse, do not address the user, no preamble, first line must be `TITLE:`. `parseTitleAndBody` now includes the FULL reply in the error (not the first 200 chars) so refusals are diagnosable.
- **promoteToIdea** — dropped `parseTurns`. Sends whole chat as transcript via the helper.
- **promoteToDesign** — same. Works for both chat and idea inputs.
- **promoteToPlan** — same. Works for chat / idea / design inputs.
- **refineIdea** — switched to helper (was already single-message but lacked refusal-hardening + better error).
- **refinePlan** — same.
- **chatReply** — untouched. Turn-splitting is correct there.
- **summarise** — already correct shape, untouched.

### Build + tests

- `bash scripts/build-all.sh` — clean.
- `bash scripts/test-all.sh` — same result as on a clean main: every test passes EXCEPT one pre-existing failure (`workspace-workflow.test.ts: weave must surface chat doc from ai-chats/`). I verified by stashing my changes, rebuilding, and re-running — same failure on stock `main`. **Not introduced by this work.** Worth filing as a separate item.
- `npm run build && npm run package` in `packages/vscode/` — fresh `loom-vscode-0.1.0.vsix` produced (367 KB).

### Next

Reinstall the vsix, reload the window so the MCP server respawns with the new app dist, and retry **Promote chat → idea** on this very chat. Expected: succeeds first try.

If it does, mark Phase 0 step 5 ✅ (and probably file the `ai-chats/` surfacing bug as a Phase-1-or-later item).

Stopping for the smoke test.

## Rafa:

- test ok, step 5 maked ✅

### Correct path
I am concern why all these method was constructed above chat.
Please add to CLAUDE.md something like.
When need to choose between paths to fix/implement something always pick the correct path, the one that is going to last forever, that makes architectural, app sense. Never prefer the shorter, fast path in front of the correct on.
Agree? (Write it with better English semantics)

### Chat weakness
In line 789 you wrote:
```
- It also breaks when the chat starts with `## AI:` or has uneven turn counts — the model sees a malformed "conversation" and reacts to *that* instead of doing the task.
```

Well, this shoulb be fixed also, chat workflow should remain strong no matter these issues and AI, should just reply

### MCP timed out
Why this error happens so usually? 
This need to be fixed
## AI:

### Step 5 ✅ — Phase 0 closed

Noted. Phase 0 is done. Ready to start Phase 1 (`loom install` template parity, steps 6–9) once the items below are settled.

### 1. The "Correct Path" principle — proposed CLAUDE.md addition

Fully agree. The TITLE: parser band-aid was a textbook example of the wrong reflex — patching the symptom (lenient regex) instead of the cause (wrong message shape). Costs us a round-trip every time.

Proposed wording, to add as a new section under **Collaboration style** in CLAUDE.md (right after the existing "Always choose the cleanest, most correct approach" bullet, which it sharpens):

> **Correct path over short path.** When more than one fix or implementation route is available, choose the one that is architecturally sound and durable — the path that will still be right months from now — even if it requires more work, more files, or a wider refactor. Never trade correctness for speed. A patch that masks a root cause is a future bug with interest accrued: the next failure will be harder to diagnose because the symptom will have shifted. Before proposing a fix, name the root cause out loud; if your proposal does not address it, say so explicitly and justify why a workaround is acceptable here. Default is always: fix the cause, not the symptom.

This is stronger than the current bullet because it (a) names the failure mode (symptom-fix masking root cause), (b) requires explicit justification for any workaround, and (c) makes "name the root cause" a precondition for proposing a fix.

Want me to land this verbatim, or tweak first?

### 2. Chat workflow weakness

You are right — robustness of the chat workflow is non-negotiable. Status:

- **Promote/refine paths**: already fixed by option 3 just landed. They no longer use `parseTurns`; they send the whole chat as one transcript. Uneven turns / leading `## AI:` are no longer a problem there.
- **chatReply** (`packages/app/src/chatReply.ts`): still uses `parseTurns`. This is the one remaining surface where the weakness lives. Failure modes today:
  - Chat starts with `## AI:` (no user turn yet) → `turns.length === 0` after filter? Actually no, it would have one assistant-only turn, then we send `[system, assistant]` to the model with no user prompt — model gets confused.
  - Two consecutive `## Rafa:` blocks → two adjacent user turns, which most APIs reject or treat oddly.
  - Code-fenced `## ` inside a turn → treated as a fake header, splits the turn.
  - Trailing empty `## Rafa:` block (the user pressed reply on an empty draft) → empty user turn filtered out, model replies to the previous-previous turn.

**Proposed fix for chatReply** (clean path, not a patch):

  1. Parse turns leniently: collapse consecutive same-role turns, ignore turns inside code fences, drop empty turns.
  2. Require at least one non-empty `## Rafa:` (or other user-named) turn as the *last* turn before allowing a reply. If the last turn is `## AI:`, refuse with a clear "write something under `## {You}:` first" error rather than sending broken messages to the model.
  3. If the chat is malformed in any other way (e.g. starts with `## AI:`), normalize to: `[system, user: <full chat verbatim>]` + a small instruction "Continue the conversation by responding to the most recent user message." This is the same single-message strategy as promote/refine, used as a fallback for malformed chats.

Net effect: chatReply works no matter what shape the chat is in. Same robustness principle applied to the one place still vulnerable.

### 3. MCP timed out — root cause + fix

This one I dug into. The cause is concrete:

**Root cause**: in `packages/vscode/src/mcp-client.ts`, `client.callTool(...)` and `client.readResource(...)` are called with NO `RequestOptions`. The MCP SDK default request timeout is **60 seconds**. Two failure shapes follow:

  - **AI-bound tools** (`loom_promote`, `loom_refine_*`, `loom_generate_*`, `loom_do_step`): these round-trip through sampling → DeepSeek → back. On a 700-line chat the sampling call alone can take 60–120s. Any call near or past 60s gets killed mid-flight with JSON-RPC error 32001 (request timeout). The treeProvider already detects `32001` / "timed out" and shows the "MCP timed out — click to reconnect" node — but the timeout itself is the bug, not the rendering.
  - **State reads** (`loom://state?status=...`): these are usually fast, but on cold-start the server has to build the link index over the whole workspace. On the first read after a reload, this can edge past 60s on this repo. Same 32001.

**Fix (clean path)**: pass an explicit `RequestOptions { timeout: ... }` per call class. Long timeouts for AI-bound tools (e.g. 5 minutes), shorter but still generous for resource reads (e.g. 30s with a clear "still loading" signal). Centralize the call wrappers so every callsite picks the right class. Optionally also bump server-side: ensure the server does not enforce a tighter limit than the client.

A secondary improvement: a heartbeat / progress notification from server to client during long sampling, so the SDK does not consider the request idle. The MCP spec supports `notifications/progress` for exactly this. Adding it makes timeouts disappear even with longer AI calls because the client sees the request is alive.

Minimum fix to land first: explicit `timeout: 300_000` on AI-bound tool calls. Cheapest, biggest win, no protocol change. The progress-notification work can come later as a polish.

### Suggested order of work (waiting for go)

1. Land the CLAUDE.md "Correct path" addition (after you approve wording).
2. Land the chatReply robustness fix.
3. Land the MCP timeout fix (RequestOptions on the vscode mcp-client; later: progress notifications from the server).
4. Commit + push.
5. Then start Phase 1 step 6 (`loom install` template parity).

Stopping for direction. Pick any subset / change order / tweak the CLAUDE.md wording.

## Rafa:

Do 1-4
## AI:

### 1-4 done

Commit `95aa5d1` pushed to `main`.

- **CLAUDE.md** — new "Correct path over short path" bullet under Collaboration style. Verbatim wording you approved.
- **chatReply.ts** — rewritten. Lenient parser (skips `## ` inside code fences, collapses consecutive same-role turns, drops empties). Well-formed chats go as turns; malformed shapes fall back to single-message mode (`<CHAT>...</CHAT>` block + "reply to the most recent user message" instruction). Only refuses on a literally empty chat.
- **mcp-client.ts** — explicit `RequestOptions { timeout }` per call class. Centralized constants: `AI_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MS = 5min` (any tool starting with `loom_promote` / `loom_refine_` / `loom_generate_` / `loom_do_step`), `RESOURCE_READ_TIMEOUT_MS = 2min` (state reads — covers cold-start link-index build), `TOOL_TIMEOUT_MS = 60s` (plain mutations).
- **Build + tests** — clean. Same single pre-existing `workspace-workflow.test.ts: weave must surface chat doc from ai-chats/` failure as on stock main, unchanged by this work.
- **vsix** — repackaged: `loom-vscode-0.1.0.vsix` (367.81 KB).

Reinstall + reload, then we are clear to start Phase 1 step 6 (`loom install` template parity) — that is the next thing on the plan.

Next: waiting for `go` to start Phase 1 step 6, or pre-flight smoke-test guidance for the 1-3 fixes if you want to verify before moving on.

## Rafa:

Phase 1, Steps 6-9 done and marked ✅

Only issue I found (j:/loom_test):
I ran `loom install` from a terminal
When I open the workspace from VSCode did not detect loom was already setup and run `loom install` process again

## AI:

### Phase 1 ✅ — and the install-loop bug

Noted Steps 6–9 done. The bug you hit is real and a one-line fix (now landed).

### Root cause

`loom install` writes `.mcp.json` at the **project root** — that is the canonical Claude Code project-scoped MCP config location, and `.loom/CLAUDE.md` documents it as such.

But `detectMcpConfig` in `packages/vscode/src/extension.ts:240` checks four candidates and **none of them is `.mcp.json` at root**. It looks at `.claude/mcp.json`, `.claude.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`. So after a successful install:

- `.loom/` exists → `loomDirOk = true`
- `.loom/CLAUDE.md` exists → `claudeMdOk = true`
- `.mcp.json` at root exists but is not in the candidates list → `mcpOk = false` ❌

`showSetupNotification` then fires "Set up Loom MCP for this workspace?" → user clicks → `runLoomInstall()` runs again. The install is idempotent so nothing is destroyed, but the loop is real and the UX is wrong.

This is exactly the kind of thing the new "Correct path" rule is for: the writer (`installWorkspace`) and the reader (`detectMcpConfig`) disagreed about where the config lives. Patching only one side (e.g., suppressing the notification with a "shown once" flag) would mask the real bug; fixing the reader to match the writer is the durable fix.

### Fix landed

Added `path.join(workspaceRoot, ".mcp.json")` as the **first** candidate in `detectMcpConfig` (it is the canonical one, deserves first place). Comment in code points at this exact failure mode so future-us does not re-introduce it.

Built + packaged: fresh `loom-vscode-0.1.0.vsix` (367.81 KB).

### Smoke-test

In `j:/loom_test`:
1. Reinstall the new vsix, reload the window.
2. The "Set up Loom MCP" notification should NOT fire. The MCP status bar should show `$(plug) Loom MCP` (connected).
3. Reload again — still no notification.

If the smoke-test passes, mark the bug fixed and we are clear for Phase 2.

### Two adjacent cleanups (low priority, calling them out for transparency)

- The `.claude.json` candidate at line 243 reads a *project-relative* `.claude.json`, but the real Claude Code user-global config is `~/.claude.json` (per `.loom/CLAUDE.md`). The project-relative candidate is dead code — it will never match for a real install. Worth deleting in a future tidy-up.
- The `.loom/**` file watcher catches install-time changes to `.loom/`, which indirectly re-runs `syncSetupContext`. But the new `.mcp.json` write at root is NOT watched. Currently fine because `.loom/CLAUDE.md` rewrite always co-occurs, but worth adding `.mcp.json` to the watch list defensively.

Both are tidy-ups, not blockers. Mention only — not landing now.

Next: waiting for your smoke-test on the vsix, then on to Phase 2.

## Rafa:

Do Phase 2 Steps 10-15

## AI:

### Phase 2 ✅ — steps 10-15 done, commit db583ad pushed

**Audit results before fixes:**

| Step | Status before | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 10 generateGlobalCtx | stub showing "coming soon" | implemented |
| 11 refineDesign | bypassed MCP (`runEvent` REFINE_DESIGN, no AI sampling) | fixed |
| 12 refineIdea/refinePlan | already through MCP ✅ | verified |
| 13 summarise | bypassed MCP (direct app + local AI client) | fixed |
| 14 chatReply MCP tool | wrote file directly, did not use `loom_append_to_chat` | fixed |
| 15 promoteTo* | all three through `loom_promote` ✅ | verified |

**New MCP tools:**
- `loom_refine_design` — wraps a new `app/refineDesign.ts` (analogous to `refineIdea`/`refinePlan`) with `samplingAiClient`.
- `loom_summarise` — wraps the existing `app/summarise` with `samplingAiClient`.
- `loom_generate_global_ctx` — reads workspace state, samples a summary, writes `loom/loom-ctx.md` with bumped version frontmatter.

**Refactors:**
- `loom_generate_chat_reply` now writes by delegating to `loom_append_to_chat`'s handler instead of writing the chat file itself. All chat mutations funnel through one path.

**VS Code commands now MCP-only:**
- `refineCommand` → `loom_refine_design`.
- `summariseCommand` → `loom_summarise`.
- `loom.generateGlobalCtx` → `loom_generate_global_ctx`.

**Build + tests + vsix:** clean, except the same single pre-existing `workspace-workflow.test.ts: weave must surface chat doc from ai-chats/` failure (unchanged from main, unrelated). Fresh `loom-vscode-0.1.0.vsix` (366.34 KB) packaged.

### Smoke-test plan

Reinstall vsix + reload, then in this workspace try in any order:
1. Right-click an active design → **Refine** → expect new content + version bump.
2. Right-click a weave → **Summarise** → expect `{weaveId}-ctx.md` written/refreshed.
3. Toolbar → **Generate Global Context** → expect `loom/loom-ctx.md` rewritten with bumped version. NOTE: this WILL overwrite the hand-written one in this repo — try in `j:/loom_test` first if you want to keep the curated copy.
4. Right-click a chat → **AI Reply** → expect new `## AI:` section appended.

### Next on the plan

Phase 3 (steps 16-19) — empty-workspace UX, walkthrough polish, first-run notification, status bar. Mostly UI polish.

Next: waiting for `go` on Phase 3, or smoke-test results from above.

## Rafa:

Do Phase 3 steps 16-19

## AI:

### Phase 3 ✅ — steps 16-19 done, vsix packaged

**What was built:**

| Step | Change |
|---|---|
| 16 — Welcome view | `viewsWelcome` added to `package.json` (two entries: no `.loom` dir → init prompt; no weaves → new weave prompt). `treeProvider` now returns `[]` for both empty-state cases so VS Code renders the welcome view instead of a text node |
| 17 — Walkthrough auto-complete | Loom file watcher (`**/loom/**/*.md`) now also calls `debouncedSyncSetup` on create/delete, so `loom.hasWeaves` context key updates when the first weave file appears and the walkthrough step auto-completes |
| 18 — First-run notification | Audit only — function is correct. Fires once per workspace (workspaceState key), covers CLI missing → loom dir missing → MCP config missing → CLAUDE.md missing in priority order. All actions route to `runLoomInstall()` or open settings |
| 19 — Status bar real state | `mcpStatusBar.command = 'loom.reconnectMcp'` (click to reconnect). `_mcpConnected` module-level flag in `mcp-client.ts` tracks actual connect/disconnect. `getMCPConnected()` exported. Status bar uses real state; tooltip says "connected" or "disconnected — click to reconnect". `treeProvider.onMCPStateChange` event fires after first successful MCP state read → re-syncs status bar |

**Key design points:**
- Welcome view `when` clauses use existing context keys (`loom.workspaceInitialized`, `loom.hasWeaves`) — no new keys needed.
- MCP status bar no longer shows "connected" based on config file presence alone; it waits for `client.connect()` to resolve.
- The `debouncedSyncSetup` was already declared — just moved earlier in the file so the loom file watcher can reference it.

**Build:** `tsc --noEmit` clean. vsix packaged by you.

### Next on the plan

Phase 4 (steps 20-26) — marketplace publish blockers: `vsce package` warnings, README, icon assets, console.log strip, publisher account, license files, MCP templates/list handler.

Next: waiting for `go` on Phase 4.

## Rafa:

The MCP tools (loom_start_plan, loom_complete_step, loom_close_plan) have  a path resolution bug — they look for loom/{weaveId} directly instead of  resolving the weave directory correctly. 

## AI:

Root cause: The split('-plan-')[0] extraction gives the thread ID prefix,  
  not the weave ID. For example, vscode-mcp-refactor-plan-001 →              
  vscode-mcp-refactor (the thread), but the weave is vscode-extension. Only  
  coincidentally correct when thread ID = weave ID (e.g., core-engine, mvp). 
                                                                             
  Fix: Use findDocumentById to locate the plan file on disk, then extract the
   first path component after loom/. I'll add a resolveWeaveIdForPlan helper
  to fs/pathUtils.ts and replace the broken derivation in all three call
  sites.

  Vision check: this fix enables loom_start_plan / loom_complete_step /
  loom_close_plan to actually work on cross-weave threads — it unblocks the
  {implement step(s)} phase, the core feature that removesthe manual "find
  which weave this plan lives in" step.

All three call sites are using the new function. The fix 
  is live.                                                 
   
  Summary of what changed:                                 
                  
  - packages/fs/src/utils/pathUtils.ts — added             
  resolveWeaveIdForPlan(loomRoot, planId): finds the plan
  file on disk via findDocumentById, then extracts the
  first path component after loom/ to get the real weave
  ID.
  - packages/mcp/src/tools/startPlan.ts,
  packages/app/src/completeStep.ts,
  packages/app/src/closePlan.ts — replaced the broken
  planId.split('-plan-')[0] (which returned the thread ID
  prefix, not the weave ID) with await
  resolveWeaveIdForPlan(...).

  Plans like vscode-mcp-refactor-plan-001 (weave:
  vscode-extension, thread: vscode-mcp-refactor) will now
  resolve correctly instead of failing with "Weave not
  found: vscode-mcp-refactor".

  Next: waiting for direction.
