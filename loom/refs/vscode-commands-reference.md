# Loom VS Code Commands Reference

Catalogs the views, commands, menus, and settings contributed by the Loom VS Code extension (`loom-vscode`, publisher `reslava`). Source of truth: `packages/vscode/package.json` `contributes`.

> The extension is a thin **MCP client** — it talks to the Loom MCP server (`loom mcp`) for all state. It does not edit files directly.

---

## Views

The **Loom** Activity Bar container holds two views:

| View ID | Name | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `loom.threads` | **Threads** | The document tree: weaves → threads → docs. |
| `loom.context` | **Context** | What the AI will receive for the selected node (the context pipeline bundle). |

When no workspace is initialized, the Threads view shows a welcome with an **Initialize Workspace** button (`loom install`).

---

## Commands

All commands are under the **Loom** category (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → type `Loom:`). The extension contributes **no default keybindings** — assign your own via *Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts* if desired.
