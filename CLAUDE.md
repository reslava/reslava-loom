# CLAUDE.md — REslava Loom Session Contract

## Required session-start context

**Always load [loom/loom-ctx.md](loom/loom-ctx.md) at the beginning of every session.**
It is the global ctx doc — concept, architecture, and operating rules in one place.
Read it before responding to the first user turn. This emulates the auto-loaded
global context that ctx-typed docs are designed to provide in Loom.

After reading it, output exactly this line so Rafa knows the global context is loaded:

```
📘 loom-ctx loaded — global context ready
```

If the read fails for any reason, output `⚠️ loom-ctx not loaded — proceeding without global context` instead, and continue.

## Two CLAUDE.md surfaces — keep them in sync

This repository owns **two** CLAUDE.md surfaces and they MUST stay in sync:

1. **This file (`CLAUDE.md` at the repo root)** — the *recursive* contract: rules for using Loom to build Loom itself. Project-specific (mentions `packages/`, `loom/refs/vision.md`, current threads, etc.).
2. **The `LOOM_CLAUDE_MD` template in [`packages/app/src/installWorkspace.ts`](packages/app/src/installWorkspace.ts)** — the *project-agnostic* contract installed as `.loom/CLAUDE.md` in any project that runs `loom install`. No project-specifics.

**When you change session rules, MCP visibility rules, chat-reply rules, stop rules, or session-start protocol, update both.** The recursive file may carry extra project-specific guidance, but every rule shared by both surfaces (anything a generic Loom user also needs) must mirror. If a change is purely Loom-repo-specific (e.g., the active-work pointer, package paths), it stays in this file only — and you must say so explicitly when proposing the change.

Drift between these two files = inconsistent behavior between Rafa's recursive sessions and every downstream Loom user. Treat them as one logical contract with two physical files.

## What this project is

**REslava Loom** is a document-driven, event-sourced workflow system for AI-assisted development.
Markdown files are the database. State is derived. AI collaborates step-by-step with human approval.

This repository *uses its own workflow* to build itself. The `loom/` directory contains the living
design documents. The `packages/` directory contains the implementation.

## Architecture

```
packages/
  core/       Pure domain logic. No IO. No side effects.
              Entities, reducers, events, utilities.
  fs/         Infrastructure. File IO, frontmatter parsing, link index.
              Repositories: weaveRepository, threadRepository, linkRepository.
  app/        Use-case orchestration. Calls core + fs. No CLI/UI logic.
              All use-cases follow: (input, deps) => result
  cli/        Thin delivery layer. Parses args, calls app, prints output.
  vscode/     Thin presentation layer. Calls app, renders tree view.
              Currently under active development.
  mcp/        Agent surface. Exposes Resources, Tools, Prompts, Sampling via MCP.
              Implemented — released in 0.4.0.

loom/         Design documents in Weave/Thread graph layout.
  core-engine/
    core-engine/          ← Thread (idea + design + plans + done)
    id-management/        ← Thread
    weave-and-thread/     ← Thread
    link-index/           ← Thread
    ...                   ← more threads

```

**Dependency rule:** `cli / vscode / mcp → app → core + fs`. Layers never import upward.
**Injection rule:** Every app use-case receives its dependencies explicitly via a `deps` argument.

## Key terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Weave** | A project folder under `loom/`. Also the core domain entity (`Weave` interface). |
| **Thread** | A workstream subfolder inside a Weave (`loom/{weave}/{thread}/`). Contains an idea, a design, plans, done docs, and thread-level chats. The core entity is `Thread`. |
| **Loose fiber** | A doc at weave root (no thread). Idea or design that hasn't been grouped into a thread yet. |
| **Loom** | The tool itself (CLI + VS Code extension). Also a workspace instance. |
| **Plan** | An implementation plan doc (`*-plan-*.md`) with a steps table. Lives in `{thread}/plans/`. |
| **Design** | A design doc (`*-design.md`). Contains the design conversation log. Lives in `{thread}/`. |
| **Ctx** | A context summary doc, auto-generated or manually written. |

Thread layout: `loom/{weave-id}/{thread-id}/{thread-id}-idea.md`, `{thread-id}-design.md`, `plans/`, `done/`.

## Current active work

**Active design weaves:**
- `loom/vscode-extension/` — VS Code extension refactoring to use MCP (human surface)
  - New thread: `vscode-mcp-refactor/` — Refactor extension to call MCP instead of app
  - Existing thread: `vscode-extension/` — Original extension architecture (for reference)
- `loom/ai-integration/` — MCP server (agent surface), resources, tools, prompts, sampling

## VS Code Extension — Refactoring Plan

**Active refactor thread:**
- `loom/vscode-extension/vscode-mcp-refactor/` — Refactor VS Code extension to use MCP
  - Idea: Why we're refactoring (single source of truth, decoupling, consistency)
  - Design: Architecture, file structure, MCP client interface
  - Plan: 5 implementation steps (mcp-client.ts, tree view, commands, remove imports)

**Architecture change:**
- Before: `vscode → app → fs/core`
- After: `vscode → mcp → app → fs/core`

This makes the extension a thin UI client with no direct app imports.

## Document frontmatter conventions

All docs use this canonical key order (enforced by `serializeFrontmatter`):

```yaml
---
type: idea | design | plan | ctx
id: kebab-case-id
title: "Human Readable Title"
status: draft | active | ...
created: YYYY-MM-DD
version: 1
tags: []
parent_id: null
child_ids: []
requires_load: []
# design-specific:
role: primary | supporting
target_release: "0.x.0"
actual_release: null
---
```

**`requires_load`** lists workspace-relative document IDs that must be read before working on this doc.
Claude Code should honour this: read the listed docs before responding.

---

## MCP tools

> **MCP host availability:** the Loom MCP server only runs inside hosts that
> implement the MCP client protocol — **Claude Code (CLI), the Claude desktop
> app**, and other MCP-capable agents (Cursor, Continue, etc.). The
> **Claude VS Code extension does NOT support MCP today** — sessions running
> there cannot reach `loom://` resources or `loom_*` tools and must fall back
> to direct file edits (with the `⚠️ MCP unavailable — editing file directly`
> visibility prefix). The Loom VS Code extension (`packages/vscode/`) is a
> separate thing — it is itself an MCP *client* talking to the Loom MCP
> server, and is unrelated to whether the *Claude* VS Code extension hosts MCP.

### Claude Code config

Create `.mcp.json` in the **project root** (NOT `.claude/settings.json` — that file
is for permissions/hooks/env and does not honour `mcpServers`). For user-global
config use `~/.claude.json` instead.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "loom": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "loom",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "LOOM_ROOT": "${workspaceFolder}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Project-scoped MCP servers require one-time approval per project — run `claude`
interactively in the project root and approve `loom`, or use `claude /mcp`.
Verify with `claude mcp list`.

### Primary entry points

| Entry point | When to use |
|-------------|-------------|
| `loom://thread-context/{weaveId}/{threadId}` resource | Load full context for a thread before working on it |
| `do-next-step` prompt | Get the next incomplete step with full context pre-loaded |
| `continue-thread` prompt | Review thread state and get a next-action suggestion |
| `validate-state` prompt | Review diagnostics and identify issues to fix |

### Rules

- **All writes to `loom/**/*.md` go through MCP tools** — frontmatter, body, state mutations, and prose edits alike (see the "AI session rules" hard rule below for the full breakdown and the gate hook that enforces it).
- Use `loom://thread-context` before starting any thread work. It bundles everything the agent needs (idea, design, active plan, requires_load refs) in a single read.
- `do-next-step` prompt is the primary workflow driver: call it with the active planId to get context + step instruction in one shot.
- `loom_generate_*` tools require sampling support from the MCP client. If sampling is unavailable, use `loom_create_*` tools manually.

---

## AI session rules

- **Chat Mode (default):** Respond naturally. Never modify frontmatter or files without explicit approval.
- **Action Mode:** Only when Rafa explicitly asks. Respond with a JSON proposal per the handshake protocol.
- **Never propose state changes** (version bumps, status transitions) without being asked.
- Rafa uses the name `Rafa` in `## Rafa:` headers. Respond under `## AI:`.
- Keep responses aligned with the ongoing design conversation in the document.
- **Chat docs are the conversation surface (always reply inside).** Whenever a `-chat.md` doc is the active context of the session — Rafa asked you to read it, opened it in the IDE while discussing it, references a line/section inside it, or the previous turn was already written into it — every reply goes inside that doc, appended at the bottom under `## AI:`. This is not optional and does not require Rafa to repeat "reply inside" each turn. Once a chat doc is active, keep replying inside it for all follow-ups until Rafa explicitly says `close` or switches to a different chat doc. The terminal response should be a brief one-liner pointing at the appended reply, not a duplicate of the content.
- **Why this matters:** Chats are Loom's User↔AI collaboration medium and the durable context database. Replies that live only in the terminal disappear; replies inside the chat doc persist as part of the project's shared memory. Treat the chat doc as the canonical place the conversation lives.
- **MCP tools for ALL writes to `loom/**/*.md` (hard rule):** Every write to a Loom doc — frontmatter or body, new doc or existing, state mutation or prose edit — goes through a `loom_*` MCP tool. No exceptions for "small" edits, typo fixes, or appending a single line. Direct `Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit` to `loom/**/*.md` is **physically blocked** by the `loom-mcp-gate` PreToolUse hook (`.claude/hooks/loom-mcp-gate.ps1`); if you see the gate's deny message, switch to the right MCP tool — don't try to route around it.
  - Chats → `loom_append_to_chat`
  - New idea/design/plan/done → `loom_create_*` (or `loom_generate_*` if sampling is available)
  - Step progress → `loom_complete_step` / `loom_append_done`
  - Existing doc body or frontmatter → `loom_update_doc`
  - Renames/archives → `loom_rename` / `loom_archive`
  - Excluded from the gate: `loom/refs/*.md` (reference docs maintained by hand), `loom/.archive/**/*.md` (archived/deferred docs are frozen — no reducer to run), `CLAUDE.md` at repo root, anything under `packages/**`. Edits to those use normal `Edit`/`Write`.
  - If MCP is genuinely down (rare), output `⚠️ MCP unavailable — editing file directly`, ask Rafa to disable the hook via `/hooks` for this session, and proceed only with explicit go.
- **Treat MCP tool failures as findings, not friction.** If a `loom_*` tool returns the wrong shape, a malformed doc (missing Steps table, double type-suffix, broken frontmatter), or times out — stop, report what happened in the active chat, and let Rafa decide how to proceed. Routing around a buggy MCP tool by editing the file directly hides the bug; you've now also bypassed the very thing you were supposed to be testing.

### MCP visibility (required)

When calling any MCP tool, output one line before the call:
```
🔧 MCP: loom_tool_name(key="value", ...)
```

When reading any MCP resource, output:
```
📡 MCP: loom://resource-uri
```

If MCP is unavailable and you must fall back to direct file editing, output:
```
⚠️ MCP unavailable — editing file directly
```

This makes MCP usage visible. If you don't see these prefixes, either MCP is not running or the AI is bypassing it (which the rules forbid).

### Chat-reply context injection (required)

When replying inside a chat doc that lives in a thread (`loom/{weave}/{thread}/chats/...`):

- **First reply for this thread in the current conversation** — read the thread context (idea + design + active plan + any `requires_load` docs) before responding. Emit one visibility line per doc:
  ```
  📡 MCP: loom://thread-context/{weave}/{thread}
  📄 {thread}-idea.md — loaded for context
  📄 {thread}-design.md — loaded for context
  📄 {plan-id}.md — loaded for context  (only if an active plan exists)
  ```
- **Same thread, no `refine` / `generate` since last reply** — context is already in the conversation transcript. Do NOT re-read. Emit only the tool-call visibility line:
  ```
  🔧 MCP: loom_append_to_chat(id="{chat-id}")
  ```
- **Same thread, but a `refine` or `generate` ran since last reply** — re-read the context (it may have changed) and re-emit the doc-loaded visibility lines.

For a chat at weave root (loose fiber, no thread), load the parent doc(s) the chat refers to and emit `📄 {doc}.md — loaded for context` for each. No thread-context resource call.

The "is this thread already in transcript?" decision lives **in the AI**, not in the MCP server — the server is stateless across calls and cannot see the LLM transcript.

---

## Session start protocol

**Order of operations at session start:**

1. **Load global ctx** — read [loom/loom-ctx.md](loom/loom-ctx.md). Emit `📘 loom-ctx loaded — global context ready` (or the failure variant if the read fails).
2. **Load vision and workflow** — read [loom/refs/vision.md](loom/refs/vision.md) (north star — what Loom is for, what manual steps it replaces; ground for the vision-check rule under Collaboration style) and [loom/refs/workflow.md](loom/refs/workflow.md) (canonical loop, phase definitions, and transitions). Emit `🌟 vision + workflow loaded` on success.
3. **Read active work from MCP** — `loom://state?status=active,implementing`. Emit `🧵 Active: <list of thread IDs>`. This replaces any hand-written "active work" pointer; MCP is the only source of truth.
4. **Call `do-next-step` prompt with the active planId.** This bundles:
   - Thread context (idea, design, current plan, requires_load docs)
   - Next incomplete step with instructions
   - Pre-filled `loom_complete_step` call ready to execute

After the `do-next-step` call, if context is loaded, output this block and **STOP**:

```
📋 Session start
> Active weave:  {weave-id}
> Active plan:   {plan title} — Step {N}
- Next step: {step description}

STOP — waiting for go
```

**Any time a doc is read because a rule requires it** (outside session start), output:
`📄 {filename} read as required`

---

## Non-negotiable stop rules

1. **After each step**: mark ✅ in the plan · state the next step + files that will be touched · **STOP** — wait for `go`. For ad-hoc tasks (no active plan), end every response with a `Next:` line: one sentence describing what comes next, or "waiting for direction."
2. **Error loop**: after a 2nd consecutive failed fix — stop, write root-cause findings, wait for `go`. Never push forward blindly.
3. **Design decision**: when a decision affects architecture, API shape, or test design — explain options and trade-offs, **STOP** and wait.
4. **User says "STOP"**: respond with `Stopped.` only — nothing else.

---

## Collaboration style

- **Vision check (before any design proposal).** Before suggesting code, file changes, or architecture, state in one sentence which user-visible behavior in [loom/refs/vision.md](loom/refs/vision.md) this serves and which manual step it removes. If you cannot — if the proposal does not map to a vision element or replace a manual step — the proposal is probably wrong. Stop and ask before continuing. The cost of writing this sentence is one line; the cost of building the wrong thing is hours.
- Discuss design before implementing — Rafa thinks out loud and reaches better solutions through dialogue.
- When a design question is open, present trade-offs and ask — don't just pick one.
- If Rafa's proposal has a problem, explain it briefly then let him respond.
- Don't rush to write code or create files until the design feels settled.
- Do not make any changes until you have 95% confidence in what you need to build. Ask follow-up questions until you reach that confidence.
- Always choose the cleanest, most correct approach even if it is harder or slower. Patches and workarounds accumulate debt. If the clean approach requires more work, say so — never silently pick the easy path.
- **Correct path over short path.** When more than one fix or implementation route is available, choose the one that is architecturally sound and durable — the path that will still be right months from now — even if it requires more work, more files, or a wider refactor. Never trade correctness for speed. A patch that masks a root cause is a future bug with interest accrued: the next failure will be harder to diagnose because the symptom will have shifted. Before proposing a fix, name the root cause out loud; if your proposal does not address it, say so explicitly and justify why a workaround is acceptable here. Default is always: fix the cause, not the symptom.

---

## Applied learning

- Ask Rafa if something is not clear before proceeding.
- Clean approach always preferred — state the extra cost, never silently patch.
- Reducers must stay pure — no filesystem or VS Code calls inside reducer functions.
- `buildLinkIndex` must be called once per `getState`, then passed to `loadThread` — never N+1.
- Cross-plan blockers in `isStepBlocked`: missing plan = blocked, existing plan = not blocked (best-effort).
- `generatePlanId` regex matches plan IDs not filenames — no `.md` suffix in the pattern.
- `getState()` is internal to MCP — extension must never call it directly. All state through MCP resources.
